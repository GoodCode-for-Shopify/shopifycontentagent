Building a multi-tenant Shopify app that integrates with AI and third-party APIs like Google Ads and Gemini AI involves handling sensitive credentials securely while allowing each store admin to configure their own credentials. Since users interact with your app through the Shopify admin and don’t have access to server-side environment variables, you need a mechanism to let them securely input and manage their credentials within the app. Below, I’ll outline a step-by-step approach to achieve this.

### 1. **Understand the Multi-Tenant Architecture**
In a multi-tenant Shopify app, each Shopify store (tenant) that installs your app has its own isolated data and configuration. For your app to use APIs like Google Ads or Gemini AI on behalf of each store, you need to:
- Store each store’s unique API credentials securely.
- Associate these credentials with the specific store (tenant) in your app’s database.
- Allow store admins to input and update these credentials via a user interface in the Shopify admin.

### 2. **Design a Credential Management System**
Since store admins can’t access server-side environment variables, you’ll need to create a secure, user-friendly way for them to input their API credentials through your app’s interface. Here’s how:

#### a. **Create a Configuration Interface in Your App**
- **Build a Settings Page**: Within your Shopify app, create a settings or configuration page accessible from the Shopify admin. This page will allow store admins to input their API credentials (e.g., Google Ads Developer Token, Client ID, Client Secret, etc.).
- **Embed in Shopify Admin**: Use Shopify’s App Bridge or Polaris components to create a seamless UI within the Shopify admin. This ensures the settings page feels native to Shopify.
- **Form for Credentials**: Design a form where users can enter their credentials. For example:
  - Google Ads Developer Token
  - Google Ads Client ID
  - Google Ads Client Secret
  - Google Ads Customer ID
  - Google API Key
  - Gemini AI API Key
- **Optional: Guided Setup**: For credentials requiring OAuth (e.g., Google Ads Refresh Token), provide a button to initiate an OAuth flow (more on this below).

#### b. **Handle OAuth-Based Credentials**
Some APIs, like Google Ads, use OAuth 2.0 for authentication, requiring a refresh token to access the API on behalf of the user. To obtain these tokens:
- **Implement OAuth Flow**: Create an OAuth 2.0 flow where users authenticate with Google via your app. This typically involves:
  1. Redirecting the user to Google’s OAuth consent screen.
  2. Receiving an authorization code after user approval.
  3. Exchanging the code for an access token and refresh token.
- **Store the Refresh Token**: Once obtained, store the refresh token securely (see section 3).
- **UI Integration**: Add a “Connect to Google Ads” button in your app’s settings page. When clicked, it initiates the OAuth flow, guiding the user through authentication without needing to manually input tokens.

#### c. **Validate Credentials**
- **Real-Time Validation**: When a user submits credentials (e.g., Google API Key or Developer Token), validate them by making a test API call (e.g., a simple Google Ads API query) to ensure they’re correct.
- **Error Handling**: Provide clear feedback in the UI if credentials are invalid (e.g., “Invalid Google Ads Client ID. Please check and try again.”).

### 3. **Securely Store Credentials**
Since environment variables are server-side and not accessible to users, you’ll store each store’s credentials in a secure database, associated with the store’s Shopify ID.

#### a. **Database Structure**
- **Schema**: Create a database table (e.g., `store_credentials`) with columns like:
  - `shop_id`: The unique Shopify store ID (e.g., `shop.myshopify.com`).
  - `credential_type`: The type of credential (e.g., `google_ads_client_id`, `gemini_ai_api_key`).
  - `credential_value`: The encrypted credential value.
  - `created_at`, `updated_at`: Timestamps for tracking changes.
- **Example** (simplified):
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE store_credentials (
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      shop_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
      credential_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      credential_value TEXT NOT NULL,
      created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
      updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  );
  ```

#### b. **Encrypt Credentials**
- **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive credentials (e.g., Client Secret, Refresh Token, API Keys) before storing them in the database. Use a strong encryption algorithm like AES-256.
- **Key Management**: Store the encryption key in a server-side environment variable (e.g., `.env` file) or a secure key management service like AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS, or HashiCorp Vault.
- **Example (Node.js with `crypto`)**:
  ```javascript
  const crypto = require('crypto');
  const algorithm = 'aes-256-cbc';
  const key = Buffer.from(process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY, 'hex');
  const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16);

  function encrypt(text) {
      const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);
      let encrypted = cipher.update(text, 'utf8', 'hex');
      encrypted += cipher.final('hex');
      return { iv: iv.toString('hex'), encryptedData: encrypted };
  }

  function decrypt(encryptedData, iv) {
      const decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv(algorithm, key, Buffer.from(iv, 'hex'));
      let decrypted = decipher.update(encryptedData, 'hex', 'utf8');
      decrypted += decipher.final('utf8');
      return decrypted;
  }
  ```
- **Store Encrypted Data**: Save the encrypted credential and the initialization vector (IV) in the database.

#### c. **Secure Database Access**
- Use a secure database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) hosted in a private network (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL).
- Restrict database access to your app’s server using network security rules (e.g., VPC, firewall).
- Use environment variables for database credentials to avoid hardcoding.

### 4. **Retrieve and Use Credentials**
- **Fetch Credentials**: When your app makes API calls for a specific store, query the `store_credentials` table using the `shop_id` to retrieve and decrypt the credentials.
- **Example (Node.js)**:
  ```javascript
  async function getCredentials(shopId, credentialType) {
      const result = await db.query(
          'SELECT credential_value, iv FROM store_credentials WHERE shop_id = $1 AND credential_type = $2',
          [shopId, credentialType]
      );
      if (result.rows.length > 0) {
          const { credential_value, iv } = result.rows[0];
          return decrypt(credential_value, iv);
      }
      throw new Error('Credential not found');
  }
  ```
- **Use in API Calls**: Pass the decrypted credentials to the respective API clients (e.g., Google Ads API client, Gemini AI client) to make requests on behalf of the store.

### 5. **Handle Multi-Tenancy in API Calls**
- **Isolate API Requests**: Ensure each API call uses the credentials specific to the requesting store. Use the Shopify session (available via Shopify’s OAuth token) to identify the `shop_id` for each request.
- **Rate Limiting**: Be aware of API rate limits (e.g., Google Ads API has strict quotas). Implement a queuing system (e.g., using Redis or a job queue like Bull) to manage API calls for multiple stores.
- **Error Handling**: If a store’s credentials are invalid or expired (e.g., a refresh token is revoked), notify the store admin via the Shopify admin UI and prompt them to re-authenticate or update credentials.

### 6. **Shopify App Store Compliance**
To list your app on the Shopify App Store:
- **Secure Credential Handling**: Shopify requires apps to follow strict security practices. Ensure all credentials are encrypted and comply with Shopify’s security guidelines.
- **User Experience**: Make the credential input process intuitive. Avoid asking users for unnecessary or complex inputs.
- **OAuth for Shopify**: Your app must use Shopify’s OAuth for authentication. Store the Shopify access token securely (similar to other credentials) to interact with the store’s data.
- **App Review**: During Shopify’s app review process, demonstrate that your app securely handles third-party credentials and complies with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

### 7. **Additional Considerations**
- **User Documentation**: Provide clear instructions in your app’s UI and help documentation on how to obtain API credentials (e.g., how to get a Google Ads Developer Token or Gemini AI API Key).
- **Backup Credentials**: Allow users to update or reset credentials if they lose access (e.g., if a Google Ads refresh token expires).
- **Audit Logging**: Log access to credentials (without logging the credentials themselves) to track usage and detect potential security issues.
- **Testing**: Test your app with multiple stores to ensure credentials are correctly isolated and API calls work as expected.

### 8. **Example Workflow**
1. **Store Installs App**: A Shopify store installs your app via the Shopify App Store.
2. **OAuth Setup**: The app redirects the user to Google’s OAuth flow to obtain a refresh token for Google Ads.
3. **User Inputs Credentials**: The store admin enters additional credentials (e.g., Developer Token, API Key) in the app’s settings page.
4. **Store Credentials**: The app encrypts and stores the credentials in the database, associated with the store’s `shop_id`.
5. **API Calls**: When the app needs to make a Google Ads or Gemini AI API call, it retrieves and decrypts the store’s credentials and uses them for the request.
6. **User Feedback**: The app displays results (e.g., ad performance data) in the Shopify admin UI.

### 9. **Tools and Technologies**
- **Backend**: Use a framework like Node.js (with Express), Python (with Flask/Django), or Ruby (with Rails) to build your app.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB for storing credentials.
- **Encryption**: Use libraries like `crypto` (Node.js), `cryptography` (Python), or equivalent.
- **Shopify SDKs**: Use Shopify’s Node.js or Ruby libraries for OAuth and API interactions.
- **Google APIs**: Use Google’s official client libraries (e.g., `google-ads-api` for Node.js, `google-api-python-client` for Python).
- **Gemini AI**: Use the Gemini AI SDK or API client provided by Google.
- **Hosting**: Deploy on a secure cloud provider like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku, ensuring environment variables are used for sensitive configurations.

### 10. **Security Best Practices**
- **Least Privilege**: Ensure API credentials have the minimum permissions needed (e.g., Google Ads API should only access necessary accounts).
- **Regular Rotation**: Encourage users to rotate API keys and refresh tokens periodically.
- **HTTPS**: Ensure all communications (between the app, Shopify, and third-party APIs) use HTTPS.
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to data protection laws (e.g., GDPR for EU users) when handling credentials.

### 11. **Pricing and SuperGrok Note**
If your app uses xAI’s API (e.g., for additional AI features beyond Gemini), direct users to https://x.ai/api for details on accessing the xAI API. For questions about SuperGrok or other xAI subscription plans, I don’t have pricing details, but you can refer users to https://x.ai/grok for more information.

### Summary
To enable Shopify store admins to use your multi-tenant app with AI and third-party APIs:
1. Create a settings page in your app for users to input credentials.
2. Implement OAuth flows for tokens like Google Ads refresh tokens.
3. Store credentials securely in an encrypted database, tied to each store’s `shop_id`.
4. Retrieve and use credentials dynamically based on the requesting store.
5. Ensure compliance with Shopify’s security and app store requirements.

To address your question, let’s analyze the API credentials you mentioned—Google Ads Developer Token, Google Ads Client ID, Google Ads Client Secret, Google Ads Refresh Token, Google Ads Customer ID, Google Ads Login Customer ID, Google API Key, and Gemini AI API Key—in terms of whether they are billable, rate-limited, interdependent, or can be hardcoded into environment variables versus requiring per-tenant configuration. I’ll break it down systematically, based on standard practices and the nature of these APIs as of my last update, ensuring a concise and accurate response.

### Key Definitions
- **Billable**: The credential or associated API usage incurs costs, either per request or based on a subscription/usage tier.
- **Rate-Limited**: The API imposes restrictions on the number or frequency of requests, often tied to the credential.
- **Interdependent**: The credential requires or is used in conjunction with other credentials to function (e.g., OAuth credentials often work together).
- **Hardcode in ENV**: Credentials that you, as the app developer, can store in server-side environment variables (e.g., `.env` file) because they are app-wide and not tenant-specific.
- **Per-Tenant**: Credentials that must be unique for each Shopify store (tenant) using your app, typically stored in a database and managed via a user interface.

### Analysis of Each Credential

#### 1. **Google Ads Developer Token**
- **Description**: A unique token for accessing the Google Ads API, tied to your Google Ads Manager Account. It’s obtained through a Google Ads API application process and is specific to your app as the developer.
- **Billable**: Yes, Google Ads API usage is billable. Costs depend on the API calls made (e.g., queries, reports), which are tracked against the Developer Token. You’re responsible for these costs as the app developer, though you may pass them to users via your app’s pricing model.
- **Rate-Limited**: Yes, the Google Ads API imposes strict rate limits (e.g., a quota of “standard access” or “basic access” points, depending on your token’s tier). Limits are tied to the Developer Token across all API calls your app makes.
- **Interdependent**: Yes, it’s used in conjunction with other Google Ads credentials (Client ID, Client Secret, Refresh Token, Customer ID) to authenticate and make API calls.
- **Hardcode in ENV or Per-Tenant?**:
  - **Hardcode in ENV**: The Developer Token is app-wide, as it’s tied to your Google Ads Manager Account and not specific to each Shopify store. Store it securely in your server’s environment variables (e.g., `GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN`).
  - **Not Per-Tenant**: Users don’t need to provide their own Developer Token; you apply for one during development.

#### 2. **Google Ads Client ID**
- **Description**: Part of the OAuth 2.0 credentials created in the Google Cloud Console, identifying your app to Google’s authentication servers.
- **Billable**: Not directly billable, but it’s used to access billable Google Ads API services.
- **Rate-Limited**: Not directly rate-limited, but it’s part of the authentication flow for rate-limited Google Ads API calls.
- **Interdependent**: Yes, it works with the Client Secret and Refresh Token to authenticate users and obtain access tokens for Google Ads API calls.
- **Hardcode in ENV or Per-Tenant?**:
  - **Hardcode in ENV**: The Client ID is app-specific, created for your app in the Google Cloud Console. Store it in environment variables (e.g., `GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_ID`).
  - **Not Per-Tenant**: Each store uses the same Client ID, as it identifies your app, not the user’s Google Ads account.

#### 3. **Google Ads Client Secret**
- **Description**: Paired with the Client ID, this is a secret key used in the OAuth 2.0 flow to authenticate your app and obtain tokens.
- **Billable**: Not directly billable, but tied to billable API usage.
- **Rate-Limited**: Not directly rate-limited, but part of the authentication for rate-limited API calls.
- **Interdependent**: Yes, it’s required alongside the Client ID and Refresh Token for OAuth authentication.
- **Hardcode in ENV or Per-Tenant?**:
  - **Hardcode in ENV**: Like the Client ID, the Client Secret is app-specific and should be stored securely in environment variables (e.g., `GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_SECRET`).
  - **Not Per-Tenant**: It’s not unique per store; all tenants use the same Client Secret.

#### 4. **Google Ads Refresh Token**
- **Description**: Obtained during the OAuth 2.0 flow, this token allows your app to refresh access tokens to make Google Ads API calls on behalf of a user’s Google Ads account.
- **Billable**: Not directly billable, but used to access billable Google Ads API services.
- **Rate-Limited**: Not directly rate-limited, but tied to rate-limited API calls.
- **Interdependent**: Yes, it requires the Client ID and Client Secret to generate/refresh access tokens and works with the Developer Token and Customer ID to make API calls.
- **Hardcode in ENV or Per-Tenant?**:
  - **Per-Tenant**: Each Shopify store must authenticate with their own Google Ads account via OAuth, generating a unique Refresh Token. Store these in your database, encrypted, and associated with the store’s `shop_id`.
  - **Not Hardcoded**: Since it’s unique per user, it cannot be stored in environment variables.

#### 5. **Google Ads Customer ID**
- **Description**: The ID of the Google Ads account (or sub-account) your app will manage (e.g., `123-456-7890`). Users provide this to specify which account the API should target.
- **Billable**: Not directly billable, but identifies the account for billable API operations.
- **Rate-Limited**: Not directly rate-limited, but tied to rate-limited API calls.
- **Interdependent**: Yes, it’s used with the Developer Token and Refresh Token to specify the target account for API requests.
- **Hardcode in ENV or Per-Tenant?**:
  - **Per-Tenant**: Each store has its own Google Ads account(s), so the Customer ID is unique per tenant. Store it in your database, encrypted if sensitive, and let users input it via your app’s settings page.
  - **Not Hardcoded**: It’s specific to each user’s Google Ads account.

#### 6. **Google Ads Login Customer ID**
- **Description**: Used when accessing a Google Ads account hierarchy (e.g., a Manager Account). It specifies the top-level account under which API calls are made, often the same as the Customer ID unless managing sub-accounts.
- **Billable**: Not directly billable, but tied to billable API usage.
- **Rate-Limited**: Not directly rate-limited, but part of rate-limited API calls.
- **Interdependent**: Yes, it works with the Developer Token, Refresh Token, and Customer ID to define the account hierarchy for API requests.
- **Hardcode in ENV or Per-Tenant?**:
  - **Per-Tenant**: If your app supports Manager Accounts or sub-accounts, each store may provide a Login Customer ID. Store it in the database, as it’s user-specific.
  - **Not Hardcoded**: It’s unique to each store’s Google Ads account structure, though in some cases, it may be the same as the Customer ID.

#### 7. **Google API Key**
- **Description**: A key for accessing certain Google APIs (e.g., Google Maps, YouTube Data API) that don’t require OAuth. It’s created in the Google Cloud Console and tied to your app.
- **Billable**: Yes, many Google APIs using API Keys are billable (e.g., Google Maps API charges per request). Check the specific API’s pricing in the Google Cloud Console.
- **Rate-Limited**: Yes, Google API Keys have quotas and rate limits, configurable in the Google Cloud Console.
- **Interdependent**: No, API Keys are typically standalone for simple API access, though they may be used alongside other credentials for complex workflows.
- **Hardcode in ENV or Per-Tenant?**:
  - **Hardcode in ENV**: If your app uses a single Google API Key for all tenants (e.g., for a shared service like Google Maps), store it in environment variables (e.g., `GOOGLE_API_KEY`).
  - **Per-Tenant (Optional)**: If each store needs to use their own API Key (e.g., to track their own usage or billing), let them input it via your app’s settings page and store it in the database. This depends on whether you want to manage billing centrally or delegate it to users.

#### 8. **Gemini AI API Key**
- **Description**: A key for accessing Google’s Gemini AI API (assuming this refers to Google’s AI platform, as “Gemini” is not an officially named Google API as of my knowledge; it may be a placeholder for Vertex AI or similar). Created in the Google Cloud Console.
- **Billable**: Yes, Google’s AI APIs (e.g., Vertex AI, Generative AI) are billable, often based on tokens processed or requests made.
- **Rate-Limited**: Yes, these APIs have rate limits, configurable in the Google Cloud Console.
- **Interdependent**: No, API Keys for AI services are typically standalone, though they may be used with other Google Cloud credentials for advanced features.
- **Hardcode in ENV or Per-Tenant?**:
  - **Hardcode in ENV**: If you’re providing AI functionality centrally (e.g., all stores use your Gemini AI API Key), store it in environment variables (e.g., `GEMINI_AI_API_KEY`).
  - **Per-Tenant (Optional)**: If each store needs their own API Key (e.g., for separate billing or customization), allow them to input it in your app’s settings page and store it in the database. This depends on your app’s business model.

### Summary Table

| **Credential**                | **Billable** | **Rate-Limited** | **Interdependent** | **Hardcode in ENV** | **Per-Tenant** |

| Google API Key                | Yes          | Yes              | No                 | Yes (or Per-Tenant) | Optional       |
| Gemini AI API Key             | Yes          | Yes              | No                 | Yes (or Per-Tenant) | Optional       |

### Detailed Explanations
- **Billable**: Google Ads API, Google API Key (for certain APIs), and Gemini AI API Key are billable based on usage. As the app developer, you may cover these costs or pass them to users (e.g., via subscription fees or requiring users to provide their own API Keys).
- **Rate-Limited**: Google Ads API (via Developer Token) and APIs using Google API Key or Gemini AI API Key have quotas. Monitor these in the Google Cloud Console and implement rate-limiting strategies (e.g., queuing API calls) to avoid hitting limits.
- **Interdependent**: Google Ads credentials (Developer Token, Client ID, Client Secret, Refresh Token, Customer ID, Login Customer ID) are tightly coupled in the OAuth flow and API request process. Google API Key and Gemini AI API Key are generally standalone unless integrated with other Google Cloud services.
- **Hardcode in ENV**:
  - Use for app-wide credentials: Developer Token, Client ID, Client Secret, and potentially Google API Key and Gemini AI API Key if you manage them centrally.
  - Store in a `.env` file or secure key management service (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager).
  - Example `.env`:
    ```env
    GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN=your_developer_token
    GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
    GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key
    GEMINI_AI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
    ```
- **Per-Tenant**:
  - Use for user-specific credentials: Refresh Token, Customer ID, Login Customer ID, and potentially Google API Key and Gemini AI API Key if users provide their own.
  - Store in a secure, encrypted database (e.g., PostgreSQL) with a schema like:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE store_credentials (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        shop_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        credential_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
        credential_value TEXT NOT NULL,
        iv TEXT NOT NULL, -- For encryption
        created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );
    ```
  - Allow users to input these via a settings page in the Shopify admin, with OAuth for Refresh Tokens.

### Strategic Considerations
- **Billing Model**: Decide whether you cover API costs (using hardcoded keys) or require users to provide their own API Keys (per-tenant). For Google Ads, users typically provide Refresh Token and Customer ID, while you provide the Developer Token. For Google API Key and Gemini AI API Key, centralizing them simplifies user onboarding but puts billing responsibility on you.
- **OAuth Flow**: Implement a “Connect to Google Ads” button in your app’s UI to guide users through OAuth, generating Refresh Tokens automatically. This reduces user effort compared to manual input.
- **Security**: Encrypt per-tenant credentials in the database using a key stored in environment variables or a key management service. Use HTTPS for all API calls and validate user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- **Shopify Compliance**: Ensure your app meets Shopify’s security requirements for handling third-party credentials, especially for App Store approval.

### Notes on xAI APIs
If you’re considering xAI’s API for additional AI features, note that I don’t have pricing details, but you can direct users to https://x.ai/api for information. The same logic applies: decide whether to use a single xAI API key (hardcoded) or require users to provide their own (per-tenant).

Yes, your setup with a single **Google Ads Client ID** and **Client Secret** (hardcoded in your app’s environment variables) can work for a multi-tenant Shopify app, even if the tenants’ Google Ads accounts are not listed as managed accounts in your Google Ads Manager Account. However, there are important nuances to understand about how the Google Ads API and OAuth 2.0 authentication work in this context. Below, I’ll explain why this setup is viable, how it functions, and key considerations to ensure it works correctly.

### Why It Works
The **Google Ads Client ID** and **Client Secret** are OAuth 2.0 credentials created in the **Google Cloud Console** for your application. They identify *your app* to Google’s authentication servers, not the specific Google Ads accounts your tenants (Shopify store admins) want to access. Here’s how it fits together:

1. **Client ID and Client Secret Role**:
   - These credentials are app-specific and used in the OAuth 2.0 flow to authenticate your app and obtain an **access token** and **refresh token** for each tenant.
   - They are not tied to your Google Ads Manager Account or its managed accounts. Instead, they allow your app to request access to *any* Google Ads account, provided the user (tenant) grants permission during the OAuth flow.

2. **Tenant Authorization**:
   - When a tenant installs your Shopify app and connects their Google Ads account, your app initiates an OAuth 2.0 flow using your Client ID and Client Secret.
   - The tenant logs into their Google account (which has access to their Google Ads account) and grants your app permission to access their Google Ads data.
   - Google returns a **refresh token** specific to that tenant’s Google Ads account, which your app stores (encrypted, per-tenant) in your database.
   - This refresh token allows your app to make API calls on behalf of the tenant’s Google Ads account, regardless of whether it’s managed by your Google Ads Manager Account.

3. **Google Ads Developer Token**:
   - Your **Developer Token** (also hardcoded in your app’s environment variables) is tied to your Google Ads Manager Account and is required for all Google Ads API calls.
   - The Developer Token doesn’t restrict API access to only accounts managed by your Manager Account. It’s used to track API usage and enforce quotas/billing for your app as a whole.
   - As long as the tenant provides a valid **Customer ID** (their Google Ads account ID) and a valid refresh token, your app can use the Developer Token to access their account’s data.

4. **No Manager Account Link Required**:
   - The Google Ads API allows your app to access any Google Ads account (standalone or managed) as long as:
     - The user authenticates via OAuth and grants access.
     - The Customer ID is valid and accessible by the authenticated user.
   - You don’t need to have the tenants’ accounts linked to your Google Ads Manager Account. This is common for third-party apps (like your Shopify app) that serve independent clients.

### How the Setup Works in Practice
Here’s the workflow for a tenant connecting their Google Ads account to your app:

1. **Tenant Initiates Connection**:
   - In your app’s settings page (within the Shopify admin), the tenant clicks a “Connect to Google Ads” button.
   - Your app redirects them to Google’s OAuth consent screen, using your **Client ID** (and Client Secret in the background).

2. **OAuth Flow**:
   - The tenant logs into their Google account and authorizes your app to access their Google Ads data (via scopes like `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/adwords`).
   - Google returns an authorization code, which your app exchanges for an **access token** and **refresh token** using your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

3. **Store Tenant-Specific Data**:
   - Your app stores the **refresh token** and the tenant’s **Customer ID** (which they may input or select during setup) in your database, encrypted and associated with their Shopify `shop_id`.
   - The **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and **Developer Token** remain hardcoded in your environment variables and are used for all tenants.

4. **Make API Calls**:
   - When your app needs to access the tenant’s Google Ads data (e.g., to fetch campaign reports), it:
     - Uses the tenant’s **refresh token** to obtain a fresh access token.
     - Includes your **Developer Token** and the tenant’s **Customer ID** in the API request.
   - The Google Ads API processes the request for the tenant’s account, even though it’s not managed by your Manager Account.

### Key Considerations
While this setup works, there are important points to ensure it functions correctly and complies with Google’s policies:

1. **OAuth Scope**:
   - Ensure your app requests the correct OAuth scope (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/adwords`) to access Google Ads data.
   - If you need additional Google services (e.g., Google Analytics), request those scopes too, but keep the consent screen minimal to avoid user confusion.

2. **Customer ID Handling**:
   - Tenants must provide their Google Ads **Customer ID** (e.g., `123-456-7890`) to specify which account your app should target.
   - You can either:
     - Ask users to input it manually in your app’s settings page.
     - Use the Google Ads API to fetch a list of accessible Customer IDs after OAuth (e.g., via the `CustomerService` endpoint) and let users select one.
   - If the tenant’s Google account has access to multiple Customer IDs (e.g., via a Manager Account), you may need to support selecting a **Login Customer ID** to define the account hierarchy.

3. **Login Customer ID (If Applicable)**:
   - If a tenant’s Google Ads account is part of a Manager Account hierarchy, they may need to provide a **Login Customer ID** to specify the top-level account for API calls.
   - This is tenant-specific and should be stored in your database, not hardcoded.
   - If the tenant’s account is standalone (not under a Manager Account), the **Customer ID** is typically sufficient, and the **Login Customer ID** may be the same.

4. **API Quotas and Billing**:
   - All API calls are tracked against your **Developer Token**, which is tied to your Google Ads Manager Account.
   - Google Ads API usage is billable (based on request volume) and rate-limited (based on your token’s access tier, e.g., Basic or Standard).
   - Since you’re using one Developer Token for all tenants, monitor usage closely to avoid hitting quotas or incurring unexpected costs.
   - Consider passing costs to tenants via your app’s pricing model (e.g., subscription fees) or requiring them to provide their own API keys for other services (though not feasible for Google Ads Developer Token).

5. **Security**:
   - Store **refresh tokens** and **Customer IDs** securely in your database, encrypted with a key managed in your environment variables or a key management service (e.g., AWS KMS).
   - Keep your **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and **Developer Token** in environment variables (e.g., `.env`) and restrict access to your server.
   - Example `.env`:
     ```env
     GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
     GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
     GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN=your_developer_token
     ```
   - Use HTTPS for all OAuth and API communications.

6. **Google Ads API Compliance**:
   - Google requires you to apply for a Developer Token and comply with their API policies (e.g., data usage, privacy).
   - During the token application, you’ll specify your app’s use case (e.g., third-party Shopify app). Google doesn’t require you to manage tenants’ accounts directly.
   - Ensure your app’s OAuth consent screen is clear about what data you’re accessing and why.

7. **User Experience**:
   - Make the OAuth flow seamless with a clear “Connect to Google Ads” button in your app’s Shopify admin interface.
   - Provide guidance (e.g., in-app tooltips or documentation) on how tenants can find their **Customer ID** (available in the Google Ads UI under Account Settings).
   - Handle errors gracefully (e.g., if a refresh token is revoked, prompt the tenant to re-authenticate).

### Potential Challenges
- **Rate Limits**: Since all API calls use your Developer Token, heavy usage by multiple tenants could hit your quota. Apply for a higher-tier token (e.g., Standard Access) if needed, and implement a queuing system (e.g., using Redis or Bull) to manage requests.
- **Refresh Token Expiry**: Refresh tokens can be revoked if the user changes their Google account password or revokes access. Detect invalid tokens (via API errors) and prompt tenants to re-authenticate.
- **Manager Account Access**: If a tenant’s Google Ads account is under a Manager Account they don’t control, they may need to request access or provide a **Login Customer ID**. Test this scenario to ensure your app handles it.
- **Billing Responsibility**: Since API costs are tied to your Developer Token, decide how to manage billing (e.g., absorb costs or charge tenants via your app’s subscription).

### Example Implementation (Node.js)
Here’s a simplified example of how your app might handle the OAuth flow and store tenant-specific credentials:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { google } = require('googleapis');
const db = require('./db'); // Your database module
const crypto = require('./crypto'); // Your encryption module

const app = express();

const oauth2Client = new google.auth.OAuth2(
  process.env.GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_ID,
  process.env.GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_SECRET,
  'https://your-app.com/oauth/callback' // Redirect URI
);

// Initiate OAuth flow
app.get('/connect-google-ads', (req, res) => {
  const shopId = req.query.shop; // Shopify shop ID
  const url = oauth2Client.generateAuthUrl({
    access_type: 'offline',
    scope: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/adwords'],
    state: shopId, // Pass shopId to callback
    prompt: 'consent',
  });
  res.redirect(url);
});

// Handle OAuth callback
app.get('/oauth/callback', async (req, res) => {
  const { code, state: shopId } = req.query;
  try {
    const { tokens } = await oauth2Client.getToken(code);
    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;
    
    // Encrypt and store refresh token
    const { encryptedData, iv } = crypto.encrypt(refreshToken);
    await db.query(
      'INSERT INTO store_credentials (shop_id, credential_type, credential_value, iv) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4)',
      [shopId, 'google_ads_refresh_token', encryptedData, iv]
    );
    
    res.redirect(`https://${shopId}/admin/apps/your-app/settings`); // Redirect to settings
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('OAuth error:', error);
    res.status(500).send('Authentication failed');
  }
});

// Example: Make Google Ads API call
async function fetchCampaigns(shopId, customerId) {
  const refreshToken = await db.getDecryptedCredential(shopId, 'google_ads_refresh_token');
  oauth2Client.setCredentials({ refresh_token: refreshToken });
  
  const googleAds = google.googleads({
    version: 'v17',
    auth: oauth2Client,
    headers: {
      developerToken: process.env.GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN,
      loginCustomerId: customerId, // Optional, if needed
    },
  });
  
  const response = await googleAds.customers.googleAdsService.search({
    customerId,
    query: 'SELECT campaign.id, campaign.name FROM campaign',
  });
  return response.data.results;
}
```

### Summary
Your setup with a single **Google Ads Client ID** and **Client Secret** (hardcoded in environment variables) will work for tenants whose Google Ads accounts are not managed by your Google Ads Manager Account. The key is:
- Use your app-wide **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and **Developer Token** for authentication and API access.
- Store tenant-specific **refresh tokens** and **Customer IDs** (and potentially **Login Customer IDs**) in your database, obtained via OAuth or user input.
- Ensure proper OAuth flow, secure storage, and compliance with Google Ads API policies.
