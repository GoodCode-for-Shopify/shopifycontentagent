## Step Details:
This step involves creating a backend API endpoint that the Shopify App frontend will use during the first step of content creation: Product Selection. This API will allow the frontend to send selected Shopify product IDs (or potentially search queries for products) to the backend. The backend will then validate these products against the Shopify Admin API to fetch their details (like title, description, image URL) which are needed for subsequent content generation steps.

**Key Activities:**
*   **Backend (Cloud Functions - Express App):**
    *   Define a new route, e.g., `POST /api/shopify/validate-products` or `GET /api/shopify/products/search` (if implementing search).
    *   This endpoint must be protected by the `authenticateShopifyRequest` middleware to identify the `shop_id` and get the shop-specific Shopify access token.
    *   **Logic for `POST /api/shopify/validate-products` (if frontend sends IDs):**
        1.  Accepts a list of product IDs from the request body.
        2.  Retrieves the encrypted Shopify access token for the `shop_id` from Firestore (using `getDecryptedCredential` or similar).
        3.  Uses the Shopify Admin API (e.g., via `@shopify/shopify-api-node` library or direct `fetch`) to fetch details for the provided product IDs.
        4.  Validates that the products belong to the current shop and are accessible.
        5.  Returns a list of validated product data (ID, title, description, image URL, etc.) or an error if products are invalid or inaccessible.
    *   **Logic for `GET /api/shopify/products/search` (if implementing autocomplete/search):**
        1.  Accepts a search query.
        2.  Fetches and uses the Shopify access token.
        3.  Calls Shopify Admin API (e.g., `products.json?title=query` or GraphQL product search).
        4.  Returns a list of matching products.

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] **Shopify API Client Setup:**
    - [ ] Ensure you have a robust way to initialize a Shopify API client (e.g., using `@shopify/shopify-api-node`) with the shop's decrypted access token within your backend function.
- [ ] **Backend API Endpoint(s):**
    - [ ] **Choose approach:**
        - [ ] Option A: `POST /api/shopify/validate-products` (frontend sends selected product IDs).
        - [ ] Option B: `GET /api/shopify/products/search` (frontend sends search query for autocomplete).
        - [ ] (Or both, if needed). For MVP, Option A might be simpler if the frontend handles product selection UI with Shopify's App Bridge components that already provide product IDs.
    - [ ] **Implement selected endpoint(s):**
        - [ ] Define the route(s) in the Express app (e.g., within `shopifyRouter`).
        - [ ] Apply the `authenticateShopifyRequest` middleware.
        - [ ] **Core Logic:**
            - [ ] Get `shop_id` from `req`.
            - [ ] Retrieve and decrypt the shop's Shopify access token.
            - [ ] Initialize Shopify API client.
            - [ ] If validating IDs: Receive product IDs, query Shopify for each.
            - [ ] If searching: Receive query, call Shopify product search.
            - [ ] Format the response to include necessary product details (ID, title, description, main image URL, product URL).
        - [ ] Implement error handling (Shopify API errors, product not found, etc.) using the global API error handling strategy.
- [ ] **Testing:**
    - [ ] Test with valid product IDs/search queries for an authenticated shop.
    - [ ] Test with invalid product IDs/search queries.
    - [ ] Test with a shop that has no products or specific products.
    - [ ] Test with an unauthenticated request (expect 401/403).
    - [ ] Verify that the API only returns products belonging to the authenticated shop.

## Notes/Considerations:
*   The Shopify App frontend might use Shopify App Bridge Admin components (like `ResourcePicker`) to allow users to select products. These components typically provide product IDs directly, making the `POST /api/shopify/validate-products` approach suitable.
*   If a more custom product search/autocomplete is needed in the UI, then `GET /api/shopify/products/search` would be necessary.
*   The data returned by this endpoint (product title, description, image) will be crucial input for the AI content generation steps.
*   Ensure you request the appropriate Shopify API scopes for reading products (e.g., `read_products`) when the app is installed. This is part of Build Step #11.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 4-8h to 1-2d depending on search vs. validate) is for implementing and testing this backend endpoint.
*   Consider what product details are essential for the AI and only fetch/return those to keep the payload lean.
