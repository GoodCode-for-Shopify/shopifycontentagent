*   [Admin Dashboard: Backend Development](../../jules/admin-dashboard/jules.backend-development.md) (Mentions a public `GET /api/plans-listing` but this step is about fetching the *current shop's subscribed plan features*)
*   [Shopify App: Authentication & Onboarding](../../jules/shopify-app/jules.authentication-and-onboarding.md) (Context for how a shop gets a `planId`)

## Step Details:
This step involves creating a backend API endpoint for the Shopify App. This endpoint will allow the Shopify App frontend to fetch the specific features and limits associated with the currently authenticated shop's subscribed plan. This is crucial for the frontend to dynamically adjust its UI and behavior based on the tenant's entitlements.

**Key Activities:**
*   **Backend (Cloud Functions - Express App):**
    *   Define a new route, e.g., `GET /api/shopify/current-plan-features` (or similar, ensuring it's distinct from the public plan listing).
    *   This endpoint must be protected by the `authenticateShopifyRequest` middleware to identify the `shop_id`.
    *   **Logic:**
        1.  From the `req.shop_id`, retrieve the shop's document from the `shops` collection in Firestore.
        2.  Get the `planId` from the shop's document.
        3.  If no `planId` is found, or if it's for a plan that's no longer active/valid (optional check for V1), return an appropriate response (e.g., default to "free" plan features or an error).
        4.  Retrieve the corresponding plan document from the `plans` collection using the `planId`.
        5.  Extract the `features` map (containing limits like `productProcessingLimit`, `keywordGenerationLimit`, `relatedQuestions.enabled`, etc.) from the plan document.
        6.  Return this `features` map to the Shopify App frontend.

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] **Backend API Endpoint (`GET /api/shopify/current-plan-features` or similar):**
    - [ ] Define the route in the Express app (e.g., within `shopifyRouter`).
    - [ ] Apply the `authenticateShopifyRequest` middleware.
    - [ ] Implement the logic:
        - [ ] Get `shop_id` from `req`.
        - [ ] Fetch the shop document from Firestore: `admin.firestore().collection('shops').doc(shop_id).get()`.
        - [ ] Extract `planId` from the shop document. Handle cases where `planId` might be missing or invalid (e.g., default to a "free" plan's features or return a specific state).
        - [ ] Fetch the plan document from Firestore: `admin.firestore().collection('plans').doc(planId).get()`.
        - [ ] If plan document exists and is active, extract and return its `features` map.
        - [ ] If plan document doesn't exist or is not active, decide on fallback behavior (e.g., return features of a default "free" plan, or an error/empty object). For V1, returning features of a globally defined "free" plan might be simplest if the specific `planId` is problematic.
    - [ ] Ensure appropriate error handling (e.g., shop not found, plan not found) using the global API error handling strategy.
- [ ] **Testing:**
    - [ ] Test with a valid `shop_id` that has a `planId` pointing to an existing, active plan in Firestore. Verify correct features are returned.
    - [ ] Test with a `shop_id` that has no `planId` or an invalid/archived `planId`. Verify fallback behavior.
    - [ ] Test with an unauthenticated request (expect 401/403 from middleware).

## Notes/Considerations:
*   This endpoint is critical for the Shopify App frontend to tailor the user experience according to their subscription level.
*   The `planId` on the `shops` document is set during onboarding (for new users selecting a plan) or by an admin (for existing users or manual changes).
*   The structure of the `features` map returned should be consistent with what the frontend expects and what's defined in the `plans` collection schema in `jules.admin-dashboard.jules.infrastructure-setup.md`.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 4-8h) is for implementing and testing this backend endpoint.
*   This endpoint differs from `GET /api/plans-listing` (used during onboarding to show all available plans). This one gets the *specific subscribed plan's features* for the current user.
*   Consider caching plan details if the `plans` collection is read frequently and doesn't change often, though for MVP direct Firestore reads are fine.
