# 3. General: Define Initial `jules.authority.md` Directives

**Parent Index:** [Content Agent Build Steps Index](index.md)

---

## Referenced TDDs/Documentation:
*   [Jules Authority Document](../../jules.authority.md)

## Step Details:
This step focuses on ensuring the `docs/jules.authority.md` document is established and its initial core directives are defined and agreed upon by the team. This document serves as the guiding principles for technology choices, architectural patterns, and key project decisions.

Many of the initial directives have already been formulated during the project's inception and documentation phase leading up to this build sequence. This task is to ensure it's formally adopted and any immediate, necessary additions or clarifications from the project's outset are made.

**Key Directives Expected to be in `jules.authority.md` (already largely defined):**
*   Core Technology Stack (React, Polaris, Node.js, Express, Firebase, Firestore, Python PAA).
*   Multi-Tenancy approach.
*   Credential Management strategy (encryption, key storage).
*   Development Priority (Admin Dashboard first).
*   Freemium Model & API Credential Options.
*   Dynamic Plan Management.
*   PAA Data Sourcing Strategy.
*   API Usage Tracking.
*   Modularity and Reusability.
*   Multi-Environment Strategy.
*   Document Precedence.

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] Verify that `docs/jules.authority.md` exists and is accessible to the team.
- [ ] Conduct a team review of the existing directives in `docs/jules.authority.md`.
- [ ] Identify if any critical high-level directives are missing for the initial phases of development (Phase 0, Phase 1 MVP).
- [ ] If missing directives are identified, discuss, agree, and add them to `docs/jules.authority.md`.
- [ ] Ensure all team members understand the established directives.

## Notes/Considerations:
*   The `jules.authority.md` document is a living document and may evolve, but foundational directives should be stable.
*   This step is primarily about formalizing the initial set of guiding principles. Much of the content for `jules.authority.md` was generated through the TDD writing process.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 1-2h) is for the review and formal adoption, not for writing the entire document from scratch.
*   Any changes or additions to `jules.authority.md` should be version controlled.
