*   [Admin Dashboard: Backend Development](../../jules/admin-dashboard/jules.backend-development.md) (Section: "2. Administrator Authentication")
*   [Server-Side and Database Setup](../../jules/serverside-setup.md) (Firebase Project Setup for Auth)

## Step Details:
This step focuses on implementing the authentication mechanism for administrators accessing the Admin Dashboard. It leverages Firebase Authentication, allowing admins to sign in using Email/Password and potentially Google Sign-In. This involves both frontend UI/logic and backend setup for custom claims if RBAC is needed.

**Key Activities:**
*   **Firebase Console Setup:**
    *   Enable Email/Password sign-in provider in Firebase Authentication.
    *   Enable Google Sign-In provider and configure OAuth consent screen if not already done.
    *   Manually create initial admin user(s) in the Firebase Console.
*   **Backend (Cloud Functions):**
    *   (If RBAC is needed beyond simple authentication) Set custom claims (e.g., `isAdmin: true`) for the created admin users using the Firebase Admin SDK. This is typically done via a secure script or a protected one-off function.
*   **Frontend (Admin Dashboard - React/Polaris):**
    *   Create a Login page/view.
    *   Implement UI elements for email/password input and a "Sign In" button.
    *   Implement UI elements for a "Sign in with Google" button.
    *   Use the Firebase Authentication SDK (frontend) to handle sign-in attempts.
    *   Upon successful sign-in, retrieve the Firebase ID token.
    *   Store the ID token securely (e.g., in React context, state management) for use in subsequent API calls to the backend.
    *   Implement logic for user session management (sign-out, token refresh if using session cookies).
    *   Set up protected routes that require authentication to access dashboard pages.

## Action Items/Checklist:
- **Firebase Console:**
    - [ ] Enable "Email/Password" sign-in provider in Firebase Authentication for the Admin Dashboard's Firebase project (e.g., `content-agent-dev`, `content-agent-staging`, `content-agent-prod`).
    - [ ] Enable "Google" sign-in provider and configure OAuth consent screen details.
    - [ ] Manually create at least one initial admin user (email/password) in the Firebase Console for each environment. Note their UID.
- **Backend (Cloud Functions - for RBAC):**
    - [ ] If not already part of initial setup, develop a secure method (e.g., a callable function, a script run by an admin) to set custom claims (`isAdmin: true`) for the UIDs of the created admin users. This is crucial for the `adminAuthMiddleware`.
- **Frontend (Admin Dashboard React App):**
    - [ ] Create `LoginPage` component.
    - [ ] Add email and password input fields (`TextField`) and a "Login" button (`Button`).
    - [ ] Implement `handleLogin` function using `signInWithEmailAndPassword` from Firebase SDK.
    - [ ] Add "Sign in with Google" button.
    - [ ] Implement `handleGoogleSignIn` function using `signInWithPopup` (with `GoogleAuthProvider`) from Firebase SDK.
    - [ ] On successful login:
        - [ ] Retrieve Firebase ID token (`user.getIdToken()`).
        - [ ] Implement a mechanism to store and manage this token (e.g., React Context, Zustand/Redux).
        - [ ] Redirect to the main dashboard page.
    - [ ] Implement a "Logout" functionality (`signOut(auth)`).
    - [ ] Create a protected route mechanism (e.g., a wrapper component) that checks for an authenticated user/token before rendering dashboard pages, redirecting to login if not authenticated.
    - [ ] Implement basic error handling for login failures (e.g., wrong password, user not found) using Polaris `Banner` or `Toast`.
    - [ ] Ensure the Firebase ID token is included in the `Authorization` header for API calls to the backend (covered in detail when building out features that call APIs).

## Notes/Considerations:
*   Refer to `docs/jules/admin-dashboard/jules.backend-development.md` for the `adminAuthMiddleware` which relies on the `isAdmin` custom claim.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 1-2d) is for setting up the basic Firebase Auth in console, creating the login UI, client-side Firebase SDK integration for login/logout, and basic protected route setup. Setting up custom claims might be a separate small task if complex.
*   For Google Sign-In, ensure the authorized JavaScript origins and redirect URIs are correctly configured in the Google Cloud Console for your Firebase project(s) if you are using custom domains or non-default hosting URLs, especially for different environments. Firebase Hosting usually handles this well for its default domains.
*   Session persistence (remembering the user is logged in across browser sessions) is handled by Firebase Auth by default (e.g., using `indexedDB`).
*   Consider token refresh mechanisms if using very long sessions, though Firebase ID tokens are short-lived and the SDK handles refresh transparently when getting the current token.
