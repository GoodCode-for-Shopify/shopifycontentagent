# 2. General: Set up Git Repository, CI/CD Pipelines (Basic)

**Parent Index:** [Content Agent Build Steps Index](index.md)

## Referenced TDDs/Documentation:
*   [Environments and CI/CD Strategy](../../jules/environments-and-cicd-strategy.md)
*   [Jules Authority Document](../../jules.authority.md) (for Git branching strategy if mentioned there, though primary detail is in CI/CD doc)

## Step Details:
This step involves setting up the foundational version control system and basic Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. This will enable automated builds, tests, and deployments to the different environments as defined in the CI/CD strategy.

**Key Activities:**
*   Initialize Git repository for the "Content Agent" project.
*   Establish the remote repository (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab).
*   Implement the Git branching strategy (main, develop, feature/*) as outlined in `docs/jules/environments-and-cicd-strategy.md`.
*   Set up basic CI/CD pipelines for each component (Admin Dashboard FE/BE, Shopify App FE/BE, Python PAA Service).
    *   Initial pipelines should at least cover: Linting, Unit Tests, Build (for frontends), and Deployment to the 'dev' Firebase project/environment upon merges to feature branches or a common dev integration branch.
    *   Deployment to 'staging' upon merges to `develop` should also be configured early.
*   Securely configure CI/CD environment variables for Firebase deployment tokens and any other necessary initial secrets for the `dev` environment.

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] Create a new Git repository for the project.
- [ ] Push initial project structure (including `docs/`) to the remote repository.
- [ ] Define and protect `main` and `develop` branches.
- [ ] Choose a CI/CD platform (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Google Cloud Build) as per `docs/jules/environments-and-cicd-strategy.md`.
- [ ] Implement basic CI pipeline for one frontend component (e.g., Admin Dashboard UI):
    - [ ] Trigger on push/PR to `develop`.
    - [ ] Lint code.
    - [ ] Run unit tests.
    - [ ] Build the application.
    - [ ] (Optional initial) Deploy to `dev` Firebase Hosting target.
- [ ] Implement basic CI pipeline for one backend component (e.g., Admin Dashboard Backend - Cloud Functions):
    - [ ] Trigger on push/PR to `develop`.
    - [ ] Lint code.
    - [ ] Run unit tests.
    - [ ] (Optional initial) Deploy to `dev` Firebase Cloud Functions.
- [ ] Store necessary Firebase service account keys or tokens securely in CI/CD platform's secret management.
- [ ] Document CI/CD setup and basic usage for developers.

## Notes/Considerations:
*   The "basic" CI/CD pipeline should be an MVP that can be expanded in later phases (e.g., adding integration tests, security scans, deployments to staging/production).
*   Refer to `docs/jules/environments-and-cicd-strategy.md` for detailed pipeline stages and environment configurations.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 4-8h) is for the initial setup of the repository and *very basic* CI/CD for one or two components to the dev environment. Full CI/CD for all components and environments will take longer and evolve.
*   Ensure `.firebaserc` is configured correctly for project aliases if not already handled.
*   Consider using a monorepo structure if appropriate for managing the multiple frontends and backends, or separate repositories. This decision impacts CI/CD setup. (The current project structure implies a monorepo-like setup with distinct folders for `admin-dashboard-ui`, `functions`, etc., within one main project).
