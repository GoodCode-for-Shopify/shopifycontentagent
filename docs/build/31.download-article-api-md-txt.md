## Referenced TDDs/Documentation:
*   [Shopify App: Publishing & Export](../../jules/shopify-app/jules.publishing-and-export.md) (Section 7.3: Backend Logic: Downloadable Formats)
*   [Shopify App: Tech Design - Multi-Article Generation & Management Flow](../../jules/shopify-app/tech-design.multi-article-flow.md) (This API could be called by the `SingleArticleProcessor` or from the `ArticleWorkspace`).
*   [Shopify App: Authentication & Onboarding](../../jules/shopify-app/jules.authentication-and-onboarding.md) (For `authenticateShopifyRequest` middleware).

## Step Details:
This step involves creating a backend API endpoint that allows users of the Shopify App to download their generated article content in either Markdown (.md) or plain text (.txt) format. The API will take the article's HTML content (or an `articleId` to fetch it) and the desired format as input.

**Key Activities:**
*   **Backend (Cloud Functions - Express App):**
    *   Define a new route, e.g., `POST /api/content/download-article` (or `GET` if `articleId` and `format` are URL parameters). A `POST` might be better if sending full HTML content in the request body.
    *   This endpoint must be protected by the `authenticateShopifyRequest` middleware.
    *   **Logic:**
        1.  Accepts `articleId` (to fetch content from `job_articles`) OR `articleHtmlContent` directly from the request body. Also accepts `format` ("markdown" or "plaintext").
        2.  If `articleId` is provided, fetch the `constructedTextHtml` from the corresponding `job_articles` document in Firestore.
        3.  **HTML to Markdown Conversion:** If "markdown" format is requested, use a library (e.g., `turndown` for Node.js) to convert the `articleHtmlContent` to Markdown.
        4.  **HTML to Plain Text Conversion:** If "plaintext" format is requested, strip HTML tags from the `articleHtmlContent` (e.g., using a library or a simple regex-based approach, though libraries are more robust).
        5.  Set appropriate HTTP headers for file download:
            *   `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="your-article-title.[md|txt]"`
            *   `Content-Type: text/markdown` or `text/plain`.
        6.  Send the converted content as the response body.

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] **Choose/Install Conversion Libraries:**
    - [ ] For HTML-to-Markdown: Select and install a library (e.g., `npm install turndown`).
    - [ ] For HTML-to-Plaintext: Select and install a library (e.g., `npm install html-to-text`) or prepare a robust stripping function.
- [ ] **Backend API Endpoint (`POST /api/content/download-article`):**
    - [ ] Define the route in the Express app.
    - [ ] Apply `authenticateShopifyRequest` middleware.
    - [ ] **Core Logic:**
        - [ ] Get `shop_id` from `req`.
        - [ ] Get `articleId` OR `articleHtmlContent`, `articleTitle` (for filename), and `format` from `req.body` (or `req.query` if a GET request).
        - [ ] If `articleId` is provided, fetch `constructedTextHtml` and `title` from the `job_articles` Firestore document. Ensure content exists.
        - [ ] Based on the requested `format`:
            - [ ] If "markdown": Convert HTML to Markdown using the chosen library.
            - [ ] If "plaintext": Convert HTML to plain text.
        - [ ] Sanitize `articleTitle` to create a safe filename (e.g., replace spaces with underscores, remove special characters).
        - [ ] Set `Content-Disposition` header (e.g., `res.setHeader('Content-Disposition', \`attachment; filename="${safeFilename}.${format === 'markdown' ? 'md' : 'txt'}"\`);`).
        - [ ] Set `Content-Type` header (`text/markdown` or `text/plain`).
        - [ ] Send the converted content as the response.
    - [ ] Implement error handling (e.g., invalid format requested, content fetching error, conversion error) using the global API error handling strategy.
- [ ] **Testing:**
    - [ ] Test downloading in Markdown format. Verify content and formatting.
    - [ ] Test downloading in plain text format. Verify content and HTML stripping.
    - [ ] Test with different article titles to ensure safe filenames.
    - [ ] Test with `articleId` vs. directly provided `articleHtmlContent`.
    - [ ] Test error handling for invalid `format` or missing content.
    - [ ] Test with unauthenticated requests.

## Notes/Considerations:
*   Using established libraries for HTML-to-Markdown (like `turndown`) and HTML-to-Plaintext (like `html-to-text`) is generally more reliable than custom solutions.
*   Filename sanitization is important to prevent issues with file systems or HTTP headers.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 4-8h) includes library research/integration and testing the conversion and download process.
*   This feature provides users with flexibility if they don't want to publish directly to Shopify or other integrated platforms.
*   If `articleId` is used, consider updating the `job_articles` document with a status like "downloaded_md" or "downloaded_txt" if such tracking is deemed useful (likely not critical for V1).
