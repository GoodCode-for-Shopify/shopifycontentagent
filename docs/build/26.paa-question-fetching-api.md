## Step Details:
This step involves creating or updating the backend API endpoint that the Shopify App frontend calls to fetch "People Also Ask" (PAA) style questions. This endpoint will use the Node.js PAA integration module (developed in Build Step #23) to call the deployed Python PAA service. It also needs to respect plan-based feature flags and limits.

**Key Activities:**
*   **Backend (Cloud Functions - Express App):**
    *   Define or ensure the route `POST /api/content/get-related-questions` (or similar) exists.
    *   This endpoint must be protected by the `authenticateShopifyRequest` middleware to identify the `shop_id`.
    *   **Logic:**
        1.  Accepts a list of selected keywords from the request body.
        2.  Retrieve the current shop's plan features (using the logic from Build Step #20: Fetch Plan Features API).
        3.  Check if the `relatedQuestions.enabled` feature is true for the shop's plan. If not, return an empty list or an appropriate message.
        4.  If enabled, call the `paaServiceClient.callPaaService(keywords, language, region)` function (from Build Step #23).
        5.  Process the results from the PAA service.
        6.  Apply the plan-based limit `relatedQuestions.maxQuestionsToRetrieve` to the PAA questions returned for each keyword (or overall, depending on how the limit is defined).
        7.  Return the filtered list of PAA questions to the frontend.

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] **Backend API Endpoint (`POST /api/content/get-related-questions`):**
    - [ ] Define or verify the route in the Express app.
    - [ ] Apply `authenticateShopifyRequest` middleware.
    - [ ] **Core Logic:**
        - [ ] Get `shop_id` from `req`.
        - [ ] Get `keywords` (and potentially `language`, `region` if passed from frontend, otherwise use defaults) from `req.body`.
        - [ ] Fetch the current shop's plan features (e.g., by calling an internal helper that uses logic from Build Step #20).
        - [ ] Check `plan.features.relatedQuestions.enabled`. If false, return empty results or an informative error/message.
        - [ ] If enabled, call `paaServiceClient.callPaaService()` with the keywords and any language/region parameters.
        - [ ] Process the response from `callPaaService`.
        - [ ] Apply the `plan.features.relatedQuestions.maxQuestionsToRetrieve` limit to the results. This might involve truncating the list of questions for each keyword.
        - [ ] Return the processed list of PAA questions.
    - [ ] Implement error handling (e.g., if PAA service call fails, if plan features cannot be fetched) using the global API error handling strategy.
- [ ] **Testing:**
    - [ ] Test with a shop/plan where `relatedQuestions.enabled` is true:
        - [ ] Send keywords expected to return PAA results. Verify questions are returned and limits applied.
        - [ ] Send keywords not expected to return PAA results. Verify empty results are handled gracefully.
    - [ ] Test with a shop/plan where `relatedQuestions.enabled` is false. Verify appropriate response (e.g., empty list or feature-disabled message).
    - [ ] Test error propagation if the `paaServiceClient.callPaaService` itself throws an error.
    - [ ] Test with unauthenticated requests (expect 401/403).

## Notes/Considerations:
*   This endpoint acts as a bridge between the Shopify App frontend and the Python PAA service, adding a layer for business logic (plan limits) and standardized error handling.
*   The `paaServiceClient.js` module (from Build Step #23) handles the direct communication with the Python service.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 2-4h) is for implementing the logic within this specific API endpoint, assuming the PAA client and plan feature fetching logic are already available from previous steps.
*   How the `maxQuestionsToRetrieve` limit is applied (per keyword vs. total) should be clarified based on the exact definition in the `plans` schema and desired behavior. For V1, applying it per keyword is likely simpler.
*   If the Python PAA service returns a structured error for a specific keyword (as designed in V2 enhancements TDD but maybe not V1), this endpoint might need to relay that information if useful to the frontend, or just log it and return empty for that keyword. For V1 of PAA service, it might just return empty on error.
