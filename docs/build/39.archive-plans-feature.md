## Step Details:
This step focuses on implementing the specific "Archive Plan" feature within the dynamic plan management system of the Admin Dashboard. Archiving a plan makes it unavailable for new subscriptions while typically allowing existing subscriptions to continue until their term ends.

**Key Activities:**
*   **Frontend (Admin Dashboard - Plan List/Edit UI):**
    *   Provide an "Archive" button or action for each active plan.
    *   Implement a confirmation modal (Polaris `Modal`) to prevent accidental archiving, explaining the consequences (plan no longer available for new subscriptions).
    *   On confirmation, make an API call to the backend endpoint (`DELETE /api/admin/plans/:planId`).
    *   Update the UI to reflect the plan's "archived" status (e.g., move to an "Archived Plans" list or filter, disable "Edit" for certain fields).
*   **Backend (Cloud Functions - Express App - `DELETE /api/admin/plans/:planId`):**
    *   Ensure this endpoint (detailed in Build Step #38) correctly performs:
        1.  Updates the plan's `status` to "archived" in its Firestore document.
        2.  Archives the corresponding Stripe Price object by setting `active: false` via the Stripe API. This prevents new subscriptions on this price.
        3.  (Optional V1) Considers archiving the Stripe Product if no other active Prices are linked to it (as per logic in Build Step #38).

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] **Frontend UI for Archiving:**
    - [ ] Ensure an "Archive" button/action is present for active plans in the Plan List UI (from Step #37).
    - [ ] Implement the Polaris `Modal` for confirming the archive action. The modal should clearly state that the plan will no longer be available for new subscriptions.
    - [ ] On user confirmation in the modal, trigger an API call to `DELETE /api/admin/plans/:planId`.
    - [ ] Handle API success: Update the UI to show the plan as "archived". This might involve re-fetching the plan list or updating the local state.
    - [ ] Handle API errors: Display an error message if the archiving process fails.
- [ ] **Backend Logic Verification (`DELETE /api/admin/plans/:planId`):**
    - [ ] Re-verify that the backend endpoint (implemented as part of Step #38) correctly:
        - Sets the plan `status` to "archived" in Firestore.
        - Archives the associated Stripe Price by setting `active: false`.
        - Handles errors from Stripe or Firestore.
- [ ] **Testing:**
    - [ ] Test the full archive flow from the Admin Dashboard UI.
    - [ ] Verify the confirmation modal appears and functions correctly.
    - [ ] After archiving, check the plan's status in Firestore.
    - [ ] Check the corresponding Price object in the Stripe Dashboard to ensure it's archived (inactive).
    - [ ] Verify that an archived plan is no longer presented as an option for new subscriptions in the Shopify App (this part might be tested more thoroughly in Step #48 - Plan Selection UI).
    - [ ] Test any UI changes that reflect a plan's archived status (e.g., it moves to a different list, edit capabilities are restricted).

## Notes/Considerations:
*   This build step is about ensuring the "archive" part of the CRUD functionality for plans is fully implemented end-to-end (UI trigger, backend logic, Stripe impact, Firestore status update).
*   The core backend logic for Stripe Price archival and Firestore status update is covered in Build Step #38. This step ensures the UI properly invokes it and reflects the outcome.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 4-8h) is for the UI implementation of the archive button/modal, API call integration, and specific testing of the archive feature.
*   It's important that archiving a plan does not automatically cancel existing subscriptions on that plan. They should continue as per their original terms, which is the standard behavior when a Stripe Price is made inactive. This is covered in the `tech-design.dynamic-plans-stripe.md`.
*   Consider what an admin can do with an archived plan (e.g., can they "unarchive" it? V1 scope of the TDD suggests archiving is a soft delete, so unarchiving might involve creating a new Price or reactivating an old one if Stripe policies allow and if this feature is desired). For V1, simply "archived" is likely sufficient.
