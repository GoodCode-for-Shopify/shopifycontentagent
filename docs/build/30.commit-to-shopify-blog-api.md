## Step Details:
This step involves creating a backend API endpoint that allows the Shopify App frontend to commit a finalized, AI-generated article (with its text and any selected images) as a draft blog post to the user's Shopify store.

**Key Activities:**
*   **Backend (Cloud Functions - Express App):**
    *   Define a new route, e.g., `POST /api/content/commit-to-shopify`.
    *   This endpoint must be protected by the `authenticateShopifyRequest` middleware.
    *   **Logic:**
        1.  Accepts `articleId` (if using multi-article flow and fetching content from `job_articles`) or full article data (`title`, `articleHtmlContent`, `author`, `tags`, `featuredImageUrl`, `status: "draft"`) from the request body. If `articleId` is provided, fetch this data from the corresponding `job_articles` document in Firestore.
        2.  Retrieve the encrypted Shopify access token for the `shop_id` from Firestore (using `getDecryptedCredential` for `shopifyAccessToken`).
        3.  **Image Handling:** If the `articleHtmlContent` contains temporary image URLs (e.g., from an AI image generation service or Firebase Storage), these images must first be uploaded to the Shopify CDN via the Shopify Admin API (e.g., to Files or directly to the article if supported). The `articleHtmlContent` must then be updated with these new Shopify CDN URLs. Similarly, handle the `featuredImageUrl`.
        4.  Construct the payload for creating a new blog post using the Shopify Admin API. Ensure the author is set to "Content Agent for Shopify, by GoodCode.ca".
        5.  Make the API call to Shopify (e.g., `POST /admin/api/blogs/{blog_id}/articles.json`). The `blog_id` might need to be fetched or configured (Shopify usually has a default blog).
        6.  If an `articleId` was provided, update the status of the `job_articles` document in Firestore (e.g., to `committed_shopify`) and store the returned Shopify `article_id`.
        7.  Return a success response, possibly with a link to the newly created draft blog post in the Shopify admin.

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] **Shopify API Client & Token Retrieval:**
    - [ ] Ensure the mechanism to retrieve and decrypt the shop's `shopifyAccessToken` is robust (from Build Step #11 and #14).
    - [ ] Set up Shopify API client (e.g., `@shopify/shopify-api-node`) to use this token.
- [ ] **Backend API Endpoint (`POST /api/content/commit-to-shopify`):**
    - [ ] Define the route in the Express app.
    - [ ] Apply `authenticateShopifyRequest` middleware.
    - [ ] **Core Logic:**
        - [ ] Get `shop_id` from `req`.
        - [ ] Get `articleId` or full article content (`title`, `htmlContent`, etc.) from `req.body`.
        - [ ] If `articleId` provided, fetch article data from the `job_articles` document in Firestore.
        - [ ] **Image Handling Strategy:**
            - [ ] Implement logic to identify image URLs in `htmlContent` and `featuredImageUrl` that need uploading to Shopify.
            - [ ] For each such image, upload it to Shopify Files API (or as an asset if part of a theme section).
            - [ ] Update `htmlContent` and `featuredImageUrl` with the new Shopify CDN URLs.
        - [ ] Determine the target `blog_id` on Shopify (e.g., fetch available blogs, use the primary one, or allow user selection in a future V2). For V1, using the main/default blog is likely sufficient.
        - [ ] Construct the Shopify article payload: `title`, `body_html` (updated with Shopify image URLs), `author: "Content Agent for Shopify, by GoodCode.ca"`, `published: false` (for draft), `tags` (optional), `image` (for featured image, with Shopify CDN URL).
        - [ ] Make the API call to create the article in Shopify.
        - [ ] If `articleId` was used, update the `job_articles` document in Firestore with `status: "committed_shopify"` and the new Shopify `article.id`.
        - [ ] Return success response (e.g., with Shopify article ID and admin URL).
    - [ ] Implement error handling (Shopify API errors, image upload failures, Firestore errors) using the global API error handling strategy.
- [ ] **Testing:**
    - [ ] Test committing an article with text only.
    - [ ] Test committing an article with images (ensure they are uploaded to Shopify and URLs are updated in the content).
    - [ ] Verify author tag and draft status in Shopify.
    - [ ] Test Firestore status update if `articleId` is used.
    - [ ] Test error handling for Shopify API rate limits, authentication issues, or invalid data.

## Notes/Considerations:
*   **Image Handling is Critical:** This is often the most complex part. Ensure a robust process for identifying, uploading, and replacing image URLs. Consider whether to upload to Shopify Files API or as theme assets if using Theme App Extensions for rendering. For `body_html`, direct upload to Files API and replacing URLs is common.
*   **Shopify API Scopes:** Ensure your app has the necessary `write_content` and `read_content` (and potentially `write_products` if linking products, or `write_files` for image uploads) scopes.
*   **Blog ID:** Shopify stores can have multiple blogs. For V1, using the store's primary/default blog might be the simplest. Fetching a list of blogs for user selection is a V2 enhancement.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 1-2d) can significantly increase if the image handling logic is complex.
*   This API is a key output of the content generation flow.
*   The author tag "Content Agent for Shopify, by GoodCode.ca" is a branding requirement from `jules.authority.md`.
*   Consider what happens if a Shopify article was previously created for the same `articleId` (e.g., allow update or prevent duplicate commit based on `job_articles` status). For V1, a simple create is fine; updates are more complex.
