# 18. Admin Dashboard: Tenant Management View (Basic)

**Parent Index:** [Content Agent Build Steps Index](index.md)

## Referenced TDDs/Documentation:
*   [Admin Dashboard: Frontend Development](../../jules/admin-dashboard/jules.admin-dashboard-development.md) (Section: "3.1. Tenant (Shop) Management UI")
*   [Admin Dashboard: Backend Development](../../jules/admin-dashboard/jules.backend-development.md) (API endpoint: `GET /api/admin/shops`)
*   [Admin Dashboard: Infrastructure Setup](../../jules/admin-dashboard/jules.infrastructure-setup.md) (Schema for `shops` collection)

## Step Details:
This step involves creating a basic interface in the Admin Dashboard to view a list of installed shops (tenants). For the MVP (Phase 1), this will be a read-only view displaying key information about each tenant.

**Key Activities:**
*   **Frontend (Admin Dashboard - React/Polaris):**
    *   Develop a new page/route for "Tenant Management" (or "Shops").
    *   Use a Polaris `DataTable` or `ResourceList` to display the list of shops.
    *   Fetch shop data from the backend API endpoint (`GET /api/admin/shops`).
    *   Display relevant columns such as Shop ID/Name, (Manually Assigned) Plan, Subscription Status (if available, might be basic like "Active" initially), and Install Date.
*   **Backend (Cloud Functions - Express App):**
    *   Ensure the `GET /api/admin/shops` endpoint is implemented (as per `jules.admin-dashboard.jules.backend-development.md`) to fetch and return data from the `shops` collection in Firestore.
    *   This endpoint should be protected by `adminAuthMiddleware`.

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] **Backend API Endpoint:**
    - [ ] Verify the `GET /api/admin/shops` endpoint is implemented, functional, and protected.
    - [ ] Ensure it retrieves necessary fields from the `shops` collection (e.g., `shopName`, `planId`, `status`, `installedAt`).
- [ ] **Frontend (Admin Dashboard UI):**
    - [ ] Create a new page component for "Tenant List" (e.g., `TenantListPage.jsx`).
    - [ ] Add a route for this page in the admin dashboard's routing setup.
    - [ ] Add a navigation link to this page in the main layout.
    - [ ] On page load, make an authenticated API call to `GET /api/admin/shops`.
    - [ ] Use a Polaris `Page` component with a `Card`.
    - [ ] Implement a Polaris `DataTable` or `ResourceList` to display the fetched shop data.
        - [ ] Define columns: Shop Name, Shop ID (Domain), Current Plan (display `planId` for V1), Status, Install Date.
        - [ ] (Optional V1) Basic filtering or sorting capabilities if straightforward with Polaris components.
    - [ ] Implement loading state while data is being fetched.
    - [ ] Implement error handling and display appropriate messages if the API call fails.
- [ ] **Data Display:**
    - [ ] Ensure dates (`installedAt`) are formatted nicely.
    - [ ] Plan display will be the `planId` string; more user-friendly display can be an enhancement if plan names are easily joinable.

## Notes/Considerations:
*   This is a **basic** view for MVP. More advanced features like linking to a shop details page, actions per shop (e.g., change plan), and advanced filtering/searching will be implemented in later phases or subsequent build steps.
*   The "current (manually assigned) plan" refers to the `planId` field in the `shops` document, which in Phase 1 is set based on the simplified plan management.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 1-2d) is for creating the frontend page, integrating the API call, and displaying the data in a table.
*   This view provides essential visibility into the installed user base for administrators.
