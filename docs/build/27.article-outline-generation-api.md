## Step Details:
This step involves creating a backend API endpoint that the Shopify App frontend will use to generate an article outline. This API will take product information, selected keywords, and PAA questions as input, and use an AI service (e.g., Gemini AI) to create an SEO-optimized article outline. This specific build step is for the **single article flow MVP**. The batch outline generation for the multi-article flow is a separate build step (#45: `initiate-multi-article-job`).

**Key Activities:**
*   **Backend (Cloud Functions - Express App):**
    *   Define a new route, e.g., `POST /api/content/generate-single-outline`.
    *   This endpoint must be protected by the `authenticateShopifyRequest` middleware to identify the `shop_id`.
    *   **Logic:**
        1.  Accepts product data, selected keywords, and selected PAA questions from the request body.
        2.  Determine which Gemini AI API key to use (developer-provided or tenant-provided, based on plan and stored credentials - logic from Build Step #25 can be reused/adapted).
        3.  Construct a detailed prompt for Gemini AI, instructing it to create an SEO-optimized article outline (including suggested H1, H2s, H3s, and potentially image suggestions) based on the provided inputs.
        4.  Make the API call to Gemini AI.
        5.  Process the AI's response, potentially structuring it into a more usable JSON format for the frontend if needed.
        6.  Return the generated outline data structure.

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] **API Credential Handling Logic (Gemini AI):**
    - [ ] Ensure logic from Build Step #25 (for determining developer vs. tenant keys) is reusable or adaptable for Gemini AI key selection.
- [ ] **Backend API Endpoint (`POST /api/content/generate-single-outline`):**
    - [ ] Define the route in the Express app.
    - [ ] Apply `authenticateShopifyRequest` middleware.
    - [ ] **Core Logic:**
        - [ ] Get `shop_id`, product data, keywords, and PAA questions from `req.body`.
        - [ ] Retrieve the appropriate Gemini AI API key. Handle missing/invalid keys gracefully.
        - [ ] Engineer and construct a detailed prompt for Gemini AI to generate an article outline (H1, H2s, H3s, image suggestions, target length/style if applicable).
        - [ ] Make the API call to Gemini AI.
        - [ ] Parse and structure the AI's response into a defined JSON format for the outline.
        - [ ] Return the structured outline.
    - [ ] Implement error handling (AI API errors, credential errors) using the global API error handling strategy.
- [ ] **Testing:**
    - [ ] Test with valid inputs (product data, keywords, PAA questions) and an available Gemini AI API key.
    - [ ] Verify the structure and quality of the generated outline.
    - [ ] Test scenarios where API keys are missing or invalid.
    - [ ] Test error handling for Gemini AI API failures.
    - [ ] Test with unauthenticated requests (expect 401/403).

## Notes/Considerations:
*   This endpoint is for generating an outline for a *single article* as part of the MVP's simpler flow. The multi-article batch outline generation (`initiate-multi-article-job`) is a more complex process covered in a later build step (#45) and detailed in `tech-design.multi-article-flow.md`.
*   Prompt engineering is critical for getting good quality outlines from the AI. The prompt should guide the AI on structure, depth, and incorporating keywords/PAA.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 4-8h) is for implementing this specific endpoint and basic testing. Extensive prompt tuning could take additional time.
*   API usage for Gemini AI should be tracked, as per directives and later build steps on API usage tracking.
*   The frontend will then display this outline, potentially allowing users to edit it before proceeding to full article construction.
*   Ensure the JSON structure for the returned outline is well-defined and agreed upon with the frontend development needs.
    Example structure:
    ```json
    {
      "title": "Suggested H1 Title",
      "sections": [
        { "heading": "Suggested H2.1", "subheadings": ["H3.1.1", "H3.1.2"], "image_suggestion": "Image of X related to H2.1" },
        { "heading": "Suggested H2.2", "subheadings": [], "image_suggestion": null }
      ],
      "keywords_to_include": ["kw1", "kw2"] // Optional, for frontend reference
    }
    ```
