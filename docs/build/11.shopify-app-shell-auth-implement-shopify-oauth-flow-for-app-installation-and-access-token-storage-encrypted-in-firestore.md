*   [Server-Side and Database Setup](../../jules/serverside-setup.md) (Sections: "Shopify App Backend Logic" for verification, "Database Design and Firestore Setup" for `shops` collection, "Credential Management - Server-Side" for encryption)

*   Shopify Developer Documentation on OAuth and App Installation.

## Step Details:
This step focuses on implementing the Shopify OAuth 2.0 flow, which is essential for app installation and obtaining a permanent access token for each Shopify store (tenant). This token allows the app to make Shopify Admin API calls on behalf of the store. The retrieved access token must be securely encrypted and stored in Firestore.

**Key Activities:**
*   **Shopify Partner Dashboard Setup:**
    *   Ensure your app is configured in the Shopify Partner Dashboard with the correct App URL and Allowed Redirection URL(s). The redirection URL will point to your backend OAuth callback endpoint.
    *   Note the App API Key and API Secret Key.
*   **Backend OAuth Endpoints (Cloud Function with Express):**
    *   **Initiate OAuth (`/api/shopify/auth` or similar):**
        *   Constructs the Shopify authorization URL.
        *   Redirects the merchant to this URL to grant permissions.
        *   Requires `shop` (store name) as a query parameter.
    *   **OAuth Callback (`/api/shopify/auth/callback` or similar):**
        *   Receives authorization `code` and `shop` from Shopify.
        *   Verifies HMAC and `state` (if used, though `shop` is often used for validation here).
        *   Exchanges the authorization `code` for a permanent access token by making a POST request to the shop's `/admin/oauth/access_token` endpoint.
        *   Encrypts the received access token using the Node.js `crypto` utilities (from `encryption.js`).
        *   Stores the encrypted token, `shop_id` (shop domain), installation date, and other relevant shop info in the `shops` collection in Firestore.
        *   Redirects the merchant back to the Shopify Admin, into the embedded app.
*   **Shopify Access Token Storage:**
    *   Store the encrypted token in the `shops/{shop_id}/shopifyAccessToken` field in Firestore, including the `iv` and `encrypted_value`.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for all stages of the OAuth flow.

## Action Items/Checklist:
- **Shopify Partner Dashboard:**
    - [ ] Confirm app setup: App Name, App URL, Allowed Redirection URL(s).
    - [ ] Securely note App API Key and API Secret Key. These will be needed as environment variables for the backend.
- **Backend (Cloud Functions - Express App):**
    - [ ] Set Shopify API Key and Secret as secure environment variables for the Cloud Function.
    - [ ] **OAuth Initiation Endpoint (e.g., `/api/shopify/auth`):**
        - [ ] Create the route.
        - [ ] Logic to build Shopify authorization URL (with scopes, redirect URI, nonce).
        - [ ] Redirect the user to this URL.
    - [ ] **OAuth Callback Endpoint (e.g., `/api/shopify/auth/callback`):**
        - [ ] Create the route.
        - [ ] Validate HMAC signature of the callback request.
        - [ ] Validate `shop` parameter.
        - [ ] Exchange authorization `code` for an access token with Shopify.
        - [ ] Encrypt the received access token using the `encryption.js` utility.
        - [ ] Create/update a document in the `shops` Firestore collection for the `shop_id` (shop domain).
        - [ ] Store the encrypted `shopifyAccessToken` (with `iv`), `shopName`, `installedAt`, and potentially default `planId` (e.g., "free") in the shop's document.
        - [ ] Implement logic to redirect the user appropriately after successful token storage (e.g., to the embedded app's main page).
    - [ ] Ensure the encryption utilities from `encryption.js` are correctly used.
    - [ ] Implement error handling for API call failures, validation issues, etc.
- **Firestore:**
    - [ ] Confirm `shops` collection structure can store `shopifyAccessToken` (encrypted value and iv) and other installation details.
- **Testing:**
    - [ ] Test the full OAuth installation flow using a Shopify development store.
    - [ ] Verify that the access token is correctly encrypted and stored in Firestore.
    - [ ] Verify that the shop document is created/updated as expected.
    - [ ] Test error conditions (e.g., invalid HMAC, Shopify API errors during token exchange).

## Notes/Considerations:
*   This is a critical security step. Ensure all Shopify guidelines for OAuth and token handling are followed.
*   The Shopify CLI app template provides a good starting point for OAuth in Node.js. This step involves adapting that logic to work within a Firebase Cloud Function environment and integrating with Firestore for token storage and encryption.
*   The redirect URI specified in the Partner Dashboard and used in the OAuth initiation must exactly match the deployed URL of your callback Cloud Function. For local development, this will require tunneling (e.g., ngrok) and updating the Partner Dashboard / environment variables accordingly.
*   Scopes: Define the necessary API scopes your app requires (e.g., `read_products`, `write_content`) during the OAuth initiation.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 1-2d) is for implementing and testing this flow. It can be complex due to the interaction with an external service and security requirements.
*   Consider using a library like `@shopify/shopify-api` (Shopify API Library for Node.js) which can simplify OAuth and session management.
