# 22. Shopify App Backend: Implement and Deploy Python PAA Service (V1)

**Parent Index:** [Content Agent Build Steps Index](index.md)

## Referenced TDDs/Documentation:
*   [Shopify App: Python PAA Service Setup](../../jules/shopify-app/jules.python-paa-service-setup.md) (Primary TDD for this service)
*   [Jules Authority Document](../../jules.authority.md) (Directive: "PAA Data Sourcing Strategy")
*   [Environments and CI/CD Strategy](../../jules/environments-and-cicd-strategy.md) (For deployment to different environments)

## Step Details:
This step involves the implementation and initial deployment of the V1 Python "People Also Ask" (PAA) service. This service is responsible for scraping PAA data from Google Search results based on provided keywords. It will be deployed as a separate serverless component (e.g., Python Cloud Function for Firebase or Google Cloud Run) and accessed via HTTP by the main Node.js backend.

**Key Activities:**
*   **Develop Python Service Code (`main.py`):**
    *   Implement the Python script as described in `docs/jules/shopify-app/jules.python-paa-service-setup.md`.
    *   Use the `people-also-ask` library (or chosen alternative).
    *   Handle HTTP POST requests, validate input JSON (keywords, language, region).
    *   Iterate through keywords, call the scraping library for each.
    *   Implement basic error handling (try-except per keyword, log errors, return empty list for failed keywords).
    *   Format results into the specified JSON response structure (map of keywords to lists of PAA question strings).
*   **Setup `requirements.txt`:** Include `functions-framework`, `people-also-ask`, etc.
*   **Deployment Configuration:**
    *   Choose hosting environment (Python Cloud Function for Firebase or Google Cloud Run, as per `jules.python-paa-service-setup.md`).
    *   Configure for HTTP trigger.
*   **Initial Deployment:** Deploy to the `dev` environment first for testing.
*   **Security:** Secure the service endpoint (e.g., using IAM to ensure only authenticated callers like the Node.js backend service account can invoke it).

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] **Development Environment Setup (Python):**
    - [ ] Ensure a Python development environment is set up (e.g., venv).
    - [ ] Install necessary libraries: `pip install functions-framework people-also-ask Flask` (Flask might be optional if `functions-framework` handles HTTP directly).
- [ ] **Implement Python PAA Service (`main.py`):**
    - [ ] Define the HTTP-triggered function (e.g., `get_paa_data`).
    - [ ] Implement request parsing and validation (keywords, language, region).
    - [ ] Loop through keywords, calling `get_related_questions()` from `people-also-ask` library within try-except blocks.
    - [ ] Log errors encountered during scraping for specific keywords.
    - [ ] Store results in a dictionary mapping keywords to lists of questions.
    - [ ] Return results as a JSON response (e.g., `{"paa_results": results_map}`).
    - [ ] Implement basic global error handling (return 500 for unexpected issues).
- [ ] **Create `requirements.txt`:** List all Python dependencies.
- [ ] **Deployment (to `dev` environment initially):**
    - [ ] **If Python Cloud Function for Firebase:**
        - [ ] Structure the Python function code within the Firebase project (e.g., in a `paa_service` subfolder within `functions` or a dedicated top-level folder if managing separately).
        - [ ] Configure `firebase.json` or use gcloud commands to deploy a Python function.
        - [ ] Deploy using `firebase deploy --only functions:yourPythonFunctionName` or `gcloud functions deploy ...`.
    - [ ] **If Google Cloud Run:**
        - [ ] Create a `Dockerfile` for the Python service.
        - [ ] Build and push the container image to Google Container Registry (GCR) or Artifact Registry.
        - [ ] Deploy the service to Cloud Run using `gcloud run deploy ...`.
    - [ ] Secure the deployed service endpoint using IAM, allowing invocation only by the Node.js backend's service account.
- [ ] **Testing (Directly and via Node.js backend once Node.js integration is ready - Step #23):**
    - [ ] Test the deployed Python service directly with sample POST requests (e.g., using `curl` or Postman).
    - [ ] Verify correct JSON response structure.
    - [ ] Test with keywords that yield PAA results and keywords that don't.
    - [ ] Test error handling for invalid input.

## Notes/Considerations:
*   The V1 implementation focuses on core functionality. Advanced features like robust error handling, retries, alternative data sources, and scalability improvements are planned for V2 (see `tech-design.python-paa-service-enhancements.md`).
*   The choice between Python Cloud Function and Cloud Run depends on factors like desired cold start performance, concurrency needs, and deployment complexity. Cloud Run might offer more flexibility for longer timeouts if scraping is slow. The TDD `jules.python-paa-service-setup.md` recommended Python Cloud Function for simplicity initially.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 2-3d) includes Python script development, Dockerfile creation (if Cloud Run), deployment to one environment, and basic direct testing.
*   Security: Ensuring the PAA service endpoint is not publicly exposed and can only be called by the trusted Node.js backend is critical. IAM permissions are the standard way to achieve this in GCP.
*   Logging within the Python service should be sufficient for initial debugging (e.g., print statements will go to Cloud Logging).
*   The exact deployment commands and `firebase.json` or `gcloud` configurations will depend on the chosen hosting method (Cloud Function vs. Cloud Run) and project structure.
