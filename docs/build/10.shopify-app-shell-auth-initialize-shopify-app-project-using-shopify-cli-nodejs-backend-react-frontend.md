# 10. Shopify App (Shell & Auth): Initialize Shopify App project using Shopify CLI (Node.js backend, React frontend)

**Parent Index:** [Content Agent Build Steps Index](index.md)

## Referenced TDDs/Documentation:
*   [Content Agent Shopify App: Overview and Setup](../../jules/shopify-app/jules.app-overview-and-setup.md) (Section: "2.1. Initialize Shopify App Project")
*   [Server-Side and Database Setup](../../jules/serverside-setup.md) (Prerequisites for Shopify development)

## Step Details:
This step involves initializing the Shopify App project structure using the official Shopify CLI. This CLI tool scaffolds a new application with a recommended setup for both the frontend (React) and a basic backend (Node.js), which can be adapted to integrate with our primary Firebase Cloud Functions backend.

**Key Activities:**
*   Ensure Shopify CLI is installed and authenticated with a Shopify Partner account.
*   Use the `npm init @shopify/app@latest` command to create a new Shopify app project.
*   Select "Node.js" as the backend language when prompted by the CLI. (While our main backend is Firebase Cloud Functions, the CLI template often includes a small Node.js server for handling OAuth and webhooks initially. This can be integrated or parts replaced by Firebase Functions later).
*   Select "React" for the frontend.
*   Navigate into the newly created app directory.
*   Install Shopify Polaris and `react-router-dom` if not already included by the template.

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] Verify Shopify CLI is installed and you are logged into your Shopify Partner account.
- [ ] Navigate to the directory where you want to create the Shopify app project (e.g., within the main "Content Agent" project monorepo, perhaps as `content-agent-shopify-app/`).
- [ ] Run `npm init @shopify/app@latest content-agent-shopify-app` (or your chosen app name).
- [ ] During CLI prompts:
    - [ ] Choose your Shopify Partner organization.
    - [ ] Select "Create this app as a new app on Shopify Partners".
    - [ ] Name the app (e.g., "Content Agent Jules").
    - [ ] Choose "Node" for the backend.
    - [ ] Choose "React" for the frontend.
- [ ] Once scaffolding is complete, navigate into the app directory: `cd content-agent-shopify-app`.
- [ ] (If needed, or to ensure latest versions) Install Shopify Polaris and `react-router-dom` in the frontend directory (typically `web/frontend/`):
    - `cd web/frontend`
    - `npm install @shopify/polaris @shopify/app-bridge-react react-router-dom`
    - `cd ../..` (back to app root)
- [ ] Initialize a Git repository within this new app directory if it's managed separately, or commit the new files if it's part of an existing monorepo.
- [ ] Review the generated file structure, especially `web/frontend/` for the React app and `web/backend/` (or similar) for the Node.js backend stubs.

## Notes/Considerations:
*   Refer to `docs/jules/shopify-app/jules.app-overview-and-setup.md` for more context.
*   The Shopify CLI creates a functional starting point, including basic OAuth handling. Parts of this (especially backend logic) will be adapted or replaced to use Firebase Cloud Functions as the primary backend, but the CLI project structure is valuable.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 2-4h) is for scaffolding the project with the CLI and initial dependency checks/installations.
*   This step focuses on the Shopify CLI part. Firebase Hosting setup for this frontend is detailed in `jules.app-overview-and-setup.md` and would be implemented as part of a later step related to deploying the Shopify App frontend.
*   You will need a Shopify development store to test this app against. The CLI might prompt you to connect to one or provide instructions.
