# 12. Shopify App (Shell & Auth): Implement JWT verification middleware for Shopify App backend requests

**Parent Index:** [Content Agent Build Steps Index](index.md)

## Referenced TDDs/Documentation:
*   [Shopify App: Authentication & Onboarding](../../jules/shopify-app/jules.authentication-and-onboarding.md) (Section: "1.2. Authenticating Frontend Requests to Backend")
*   [Server-Side and Database Setup](../../jules/serverside-setup.md) (Section: "Shopify App Backend Logic", specifically "Replacing Mock Authentication with Actual Shopify JWT Verification")
*   Shopify Developer Documentation on Authenticating embedded apps using session tokens (JWTs).

## Step Details:
This step involves implementing a backend middleware to authenticate requests originating from the Shopify App's frontend (embedded in the Shopify Admin). The frontend, using Shopify App Bridge, will obtain a session token (JWT) and include it in the `Authorization` header of API requests to the backend (Cloud Functions). This middleware will verify the JWT to ensure the request is legitimate and to identify the shop making the request.

**Key Activities:**
*   **Develop the `authenticateShopifyRequest` middleware** (or similarly named) as detailed in `docs/jules/serverside-setup.md`. This middleware will:
    *   Extract the JWT from the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
    *   Use `jsonwebtoken` and `jwks-rsa` libraries to fetch Shopify's public keys and verify the token's signature.
    *   Validate standard JWT claims (e.g., `nbf`, `exp`).
    *   **Crucially, validate `aud` (audience - should be your Shopify App API Key) and `iss` (issuer - should be `https://{shop_domain}/admin`, where `shop_domain` is from the `dest` claim).**
    *   Extract the shop domain (`dest` claim, e.g., `your-store.myshopify.com`) which serves as the `shop_id`.
    *   Attach `shop_id` (and potentially the decoded token) to the `req` object for use in subsequent route handlers.
    *   Return appropriate error responses (e.g., 401/403) if verification fails.
*   **Apply this middleware** to all Express routes that are intended to be called by the Shopify App frontend.

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] **Install Dependencies (if not already done in `functions` directory):**
    - `npm install jsonwebtoken jwks-rsa`
- [ ] **Configure Shopify App API Key:**
    - [ ] Ensure your Shopify App API Key is securely available as an environment variable for your Cloud Function (e.g., `functions.config().shopify.api_key`).
- [ ] **Develop `authenticateShopifyRequest` Middleware:**
    - [ ] Create or update the middleware file (e.g., `functions/src/middleware/authenticateShopifyRequest.js` or integrate into existing auth middleware file).
    - [ ] Implement JWT extraction from the `Authorization` header.
    - [ ] Set up `jwks-rsa` client with the correct Shopify JWKS URI (e.g., `https://shopify-app-jwks.shopifycloud.com/YOUR_SHOPIFY_APP_API_KEY/.well-known/jwks.json`, using the env variable for the API key).
    - [ ] Implement `getKey` function for `jwt.verify`.
    - [ ] In `jwt.verify` callback:
        - [ ] Perform signature verification.
        - [ ] Validate `aud` claim against your Shopify App API Key.
        - [ ] Validate `iss` claim against `https://{decoded.dest}/admin`.
        - [ ] Extract `shop_id` from the `dest` claim.
        - [ ] Attach `req.shop_id = shopId` and optionally `req.shopify_session_token_payload = decoded`.
        - [ ] Handle errors and call `next()` on success.
- [ ] **Integrate Middleware in Express App (`functions/src/index.js` or route files):**
    - [ ] Import the `authenticateShopifyRequest` middleware.
    - [ ] Apply it to all routes that will be called by the Shopify app frontend (e.g., `/api/shopify/**`, `/api/content/**`, `/api/subscriptions/create-checkout-session`).
- [ ] **Testing:**
    - [ ] **Manual/Integration Test (using Firebase Emulators or deployed `dev` environment):**
        - [ ] Attempt to access a protected route without a token – expect 401/403.
        - [ ] Attempt with an invalid/expired token – expect 401/403.
        - [ ] Attempt with a valid token (requires a way to obtain one from a test frontend using App Bridge, or a manually generated test token if possible, though live tokens are best).
        - [ ] Verify that `req.shop_id` is correctly populated in a test route handler.
    - [ ] Check logs for any verification errors.

## Notes/Considerations:
*   The detailed implementation of this middleware is provided in `docs/jules/serverside-setup.md` (Section: "Shopify App Backend Logic"). This step is about ensuring its correct implementation and application.
*   This middleware is fundamental for securing your Shopify app's backend APIs and identifying the context of the shop making the request.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 4-8h) includes careful implementation and thorough testing of the JWT validation logic, which can be tricky.
*   Ensure the JWKS URI is correctly formed using your app's actual API key.
*   This JWT verification replaces the "Mock Shopify Auth Middleware" mentioned in earlier server-side setup steps.
*   The Global API Error Handling strategy should be compatible with errors thrown by this middleware.
