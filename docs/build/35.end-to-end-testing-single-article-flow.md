## Step Details:
This step involves performing basic end-to-end (E2E) testing of the core "single article generation flow" developed for the MVP (Phase 1). This ensures all integrated components (frontend UI, backend APIs, AI service calls, PAA service call, Shopify integration for commit) work together as expected.

**Key Activities:**
*   **Define Test Scenarios:** Outline key user paths through the single article generation flow.
*   **Environment Setup:** Conduct tests in a dedicated `dev` or `staging` environment with:
    *   A Shopify development store.
    *   The Shopify App installed and configured (onboarding completed, API credentials set up for a test user/shop).
    *   Relevant Firebase services (Auth, Firestore, Functions) deployed.
    *   Python PAA service deployed.
    *   Simplified plan features configured in Firestore (as per Step #16).
*   **Execution:** Manually execute the test scenarios. Automated E2E tests (e.g., using Cypress, Playwright) are desirable but might be deferred to a later phase for MVP given time constraints.
*   **Verification:** Check outputs at each step (e.g., keywords generated, outline structure, article text, images if included, Shopify draft post creation, downloaded files).
*   **Bug Logging:** Document and report any issues found.

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] **Test Plan & Scenario Definition:**
    - [ ] Outline 3-5 core E2E test scenarios for the single article flow. Examples:
        - Scenario 1: Happy path with all optional features enabled by plan (e.g., PAA, AI Images if in MVP).
        - Scenario 2: Path with optional features disabled by plan.
        - Scenario 3: User provides minimal input.
        - Scenario 4: Test with different product types.
        - Scenario 5: Test download options (MD and TXT).
- [ ] **Test Environment Preparation:**
    - [ ] Ensure the chosen test environment (`dev` or `staging`) is fully deployed with all MVP components.
    - [ ] Configure a test Shopify store with the app installed.
    - [ ] Set up necessary API credentials for the test shop (e.g., Gemini AI key).
    - [ ] Configure simplified plan features in Firestore for the test shop's plan to cover different scenarios.
- [ ] **Test Execution (Manual for MVP):**
    - [ ] Go through each defined test scenario step-by-step in the Shopify App UI.
    - [ ] Perform actions as a user would (select product, generate keywords, etc.).
    - [ ] Verify UI feedback at each stage (loading states, success/error messages).
    - [ ] Verify data sent to backend APIs (e.g., using browser dev tools) and responses received.
    - [ ] Verify results of AI service calls (keywords, outline, text, images).
    - [ ] Verify PAA questions are fetched and displayed correctly.
    - [ ] Verify article is committed to Shopify as a draft with correct content and author tag.
    - [ ] Verify downloaded MD and TXT files are correct.
- [ ] **Bug Reporting:**
    - [ ] Clearly document any bugs or unexpected behavior with steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results.
- [ ] **Sign-off:**
    - [ ] Confirm that the core single article flow is functional for MVP requirements.

## Notes/Considerations:
*   This basic E2E testing is crucial for validating the integration of all MVP components.
*   While manual testing is acceptable for MVP, planning for automated E2E tests (e.g., using Cypress or Playwright) should be considered for future phases to improve regression testing.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 2-3d) is for defining scenarios, preparing the environment, manual execution, and initial bug logging. This can vary based on the number of issues found.
*   Focus on the "happy path" and critical error conditions for MVP testing. Exhaustive edge case testing can be expanded later.
*   This step validates the core user value proposition before moving to more complex features like dynamic plans and multi-article processing.
*   Ensure to test how plan limits (e.g., `keywordGenerationLimit`) affect the UI and backend processing during these E2E tests.
