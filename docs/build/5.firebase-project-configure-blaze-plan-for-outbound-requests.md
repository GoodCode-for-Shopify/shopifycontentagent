# 5. Firebase Project: Configure Blaze Plan for Outbound Requests

## Referenced TDDs/Documentation:
*   [Server-Side and Database Setup](../../jules/serverside-setup.md) (Section: "Firebase Project Setup", item 4: "Upgrade to Blaze Plan")
*   [Environments and CI/CD Strategy](../../jules/environments-and-cicd-strategy.md) (regarding separate Firebase projects for dev, staging, prod)

## Step Details:
This step ensures that each Firebase project intended to run Cloud Functions that make outbound network requests (e.g., to third-party APIs like Stripe, Google Ads, Gemini AI, or the Python PAA service) is upgraded to the "Blaze (pay-as-you-go)" plan. The free "Spark" plan does not allow outbound network requests for Cloud Functions.

**Key Activities:**
*   For each Firebase project created in the previous step (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`):
    *   Navigate to the Firebase Console.
    *   Select the project.
    *   Upgrade the project from the "Spark" plan to the "Blaze" plan.
    *   Link a valid Google Cloud Billing account.

## Action Items/Checklist:
*   **Production Firebase Project (`content-agent-prod` or similar):**
    *   [ ] Verify/Upgrade to Blaze plan.
    *   [ ] Ensure a valid billing account is linked.
*   **Staging Firebase Project (`content-agent-staging` or similar):**
    *   [ ] Verify/Upgrade to Blaze plan.
    *   [ ] Ensure a valid billing account is linked.
*   **Development Firebase Project (`content-agent-dev` or similar):**
    *   [ ] Verify/Upgrade to Blaze plan.
    *   [ ] Ensure a valid billing account is linked. (Note: While it's pay-as-you-go, the free tier within Blaze is generous and often covers typical development usage without actual charges).

## Notes/Considerations:
*   This step is critical for the functionality of backend Cloud Functions that interact with any external API.
*   Cloud Functions for Firebase (2nd Gen) also explicitly require the Blaze plan.
*   While "pay-as-you-go" sounds costly, Firebase provides a significant free tier for most services even on the Blaze plan. Costs are only incurred after exceeding these free tier limits.
*   Monitor billing and set up budget alerts in the Google Cloud Console for each project, especially production.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 0.5-1h) is for performing the upgrade in the console for all projects, assuming billing accounts are already available. Setting up new billing accounts would take longer.
*   This step directly follows the Firebase project initialization to ensure functions can be deployed and tested with their required network access from the start.
