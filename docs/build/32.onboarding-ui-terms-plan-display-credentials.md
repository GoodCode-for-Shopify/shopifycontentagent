## Referenced TDDs/Documentation:
*   [Shopify App: Authentication & Onboarding](../../jules/shopify-app/jules.authentication-and-onboarding.md) (Sections: "2.1. Terms Acceptance", "2.2. Initial Plan Selection" (display part for MVP), "2.4. Credential Walkthrough")
*   [Shopify App: Core Article Generation Flow](../../jules/shopify-app/jules.core-article-generation-flow.md) (Context for where onboarding leads)
*   [Admin Dashboard: Backend Development](../../jules/admin-dashboard/jules.backend-development.md) (API endpoint `GET /api/plans-listing` will be used in Phase 2; for MVP/Phase 1, plan features might be fetched differently or be more static based on the simplified plan config).
*   [Fetch Plan Features API](20.fetch-plan-features-api.md) (While this fetches current subscribed plan features, the onboarding might initially display features of predefined plans).

## Step Details:
This step involves building the frontend UI for the Shopify App's user onboarding process. For the MVP (Phase 1), this includes:
1.  **Terms Acceptance:** Presenting terms of service and privacy policy, and requiring user agreement.
2.  **Plan Features Display (Simplified for MVP):** Displaying features of available predefined plans (e.g., Free, Basic, Pro). Active plan *selection* and Stripe integration are deferred to Phase 2 (Build Step #48).
3.  **Credential Input Walkthrough:** Guiding the user to input their third-party API credentials (e.g., Gemini AI, Google Ads) required for the app's functionality, especially for the Free plan or if users opt to use their own keys on other plans.

**Key Activities:**
*   **React/Polaris Components:**
    *   Develop React components for each onboarding step.
    *   Use Shopify Polaris components (`Page`, `Layout`, `Card`, `Checkbox`, `TextField`, `Button`, `Modal`, `VideoThumbnail` or similar for instructional videos) for a native Shopify look and feel.
    *   Manage state within the onboarding flow (e.g., current step, form inputs, API responses).
*   **Terms Acceptance UI:**
    *   Display links to Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
    *   Checkbox for agreement.
    *   API call to backend (`POST /api/onboarding/complete-profile` or similar) to record acceptance and basic user info.
*   **Plan Features Display UI (MVP):**
    *   Fetch features/limits for predefined MVP plans (e.g., Free, Basic, Pro) from a backend endpoint (this might be a simplified version of `GET /api/plans-listing` or a dedicated MVP endpoint that reads the simplified plan configs from Firestore).
    *   Display these plans and their features in a comparative way.
    *   **No active plan selection or Stripe checkout in this MVP step.** The shop might be assigned a default "Free" plan, or plan assignment is manual via Admin Dashboard for V1.
*   **Credential Walkthrough UI:**
    *   A multi-step form or sequence of views.
    *   Each step focuses on one API credential type.
    *   Includes instructions, links to obtain keys, embedded instructional videos (placeholders for URLs).
    *   `TextField` for key input.
    *   "Save & Test Credential" button calling the backend (`POST /api/credentials/:credentialType` - from Build Step #21) to validate and save the key.
    *   Display success/error feedback from the backend.
    *   Skip steps for credentials that are developer-provided based on the current (simplified V1) plan.

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] **Overall Onboarding Flow Manager/Router:**
    - [ ] Set up client-side routing (`react-router-dom`) for the onboarding sequence (e.g., `/onboarding/terms`, `/onboarding/plans-info`, `/onboarding/credentials/:step`).
    - [ ] Create a parent component to manage progress through onboarding steps.
- [ ] **Terms Acceptance View:**
    - [ ] Create UI with links to legal documents and a checkbox for agreement.
    - [ ] Implement logic to call backend to save acceptance status.
- [ ] **Plan Features Display View (MVP):**
    - [ ] Create UI to display features of predefined MVP plans (e.g., Free, Basic, Pro).
    - [ ] Fetch this data from a suitable backend endpoint (which reads simplified plan configs).
    - [ ] Ensure this view clearly states that active plan selection/payment is for a later phase if not implementing default free plan assignment.
- [ ] **Credential Walkthrough Views:**
    - [ ] Design a multi-step form or sequential views for different credential types (e.g., Gemini AI, Google Ads Token, Google API Key).
    - [ ] For each credential type:
        - [ ] Display clear instructions (text, links, video placeholders).
        - [ ] Provide a `TextField` for input.
        - [ ] Implement "Save & Test" button logic:
            - [ ] Call `POST /api/credentials/:credentialType` backend endpoint.
            - [ ] Handle and display success or error responses (e.g., using Polaris `Banner` or `Toast`).
        - [ ] Logic to skip steps if the plan indicates a developer-provided key for that service.
- [ ] **State Management:**
    - [ ] Implement state management for form inputs, current step, API call loading/error states within the onboarding flow.
- [ ] **Navigation:**
    - [ ] Ensure smooth navigation between onboarding steps.
    - [ ] On completion of onboarding, navigate the user to the main app interface (e.g., product selection for article generation).
- [ ] **Testing:**
    - [ ] Test the full onboarding sequence.
    - [ ] Verify terms acceptance is recorded.
    - [ ] Verify plan features display correctly (for MVP).
    - [ ] Test credential input, validation (success and failure cases), and secure storage (by checking backend logs/status, not by retrieving keys).
    - [ ] Test skipping steps for developer-provided credentials.

## Notes/Considerations:
*   This is for the MVP (Phase 1) onboarding. Full plan selection with Stripe checkout is a separate step in Phase 2 (Build Step #48).
*   The backend endpoint to fetch simplified plan features for display needs to be coordinated with backend development (it might be a simplified version of the eventual public plan listing API).
*   The "Save & Test Credential" API calls rely on Build Step #21 (`POST /api/credentials/:credentialType`).
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 2-3d) is for building these multiple UI views and integrating their respective API calls.
*   User experience is key here; onboarding should be as smooth and clear as possible.
*   Instructional video URLs will be placeholders initially.
*   Ensure all user-facing text (instructions, labels, error messages) is clear and helpful.
