# 17. Admin Dashboard: Ensure Firestore Plan Schema Forward Compatibility

**Parent Index:** [Content Agent Build Steps Index](index.md)

## Referenced TDDs/Documentation:
*   [Admin Dashboard: Define Plan Tiers and Limits in UI (Simplified V1)](16.define-plan-tiers-and-limits-in-ui-simplified-v1.md) (Preceding build step)
*   [Admin Dashboard: Infrastructure Setup](../../jules/admin-dashboard/jules.infrastructure-setup.md) (Section 1.2 for `plans` collection schema)
*   [Admin Dashboard: Technical Design - Dynamic Plan Management & Stripe Integration](../../jules/admin-dashboard/tech-design.dynamic-plans-stripe.md) (Defines the target V2 schema)

## Step Details:
This step is a focused review and validation task that runs concurrently with or immediately after the implementation of the "Simplified V1" Plan Management (Build Step #16). Its purpose is to ensure that the Firestore data structure used for storing the simplified plan configurations (features, limits) is designed to be forward-compatible with the more comprehensive schema required for Phase 2, which includes full dynamic plan creation and Stripe integration.

**Key Activities:**
*   Compare the simplified plan structure implemented in Step #16 (primarily the `features` map and basic plan identifiers) with the target schema detailed in `tech-design.dynamic-plans-stripe.md`.
*   Identify any potential conflicts or necessary adjustments to the V1 structure to facilitate a smoother transition to the V2 plan management system.
*   Ensure that fields being populated in V1 (like `planName`, `tier`, and the `features` map) use naming and data types consistent with the V2 schema.

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] Review the Firestore `plans` collection documents created or managed by the Simplified V1 Plan Management interface.
- [ ] Cross-reference the structure of these documents (especially the `features` map and its keys) with the schema defined in `tech-design.dynamic-plans-stripe.md`.
- [ ] Confirm that field names used in V1 (e.g., `productProcessingLimit`, `keywordGenerationLimit`, `relatedQuestions.enabled`) match those intended for V2.
- [ ] Confirm that data types are consistent.
- [ ] Document any V1 fields that might be deprecated or restructured in V2, and note if a data migration strategy will be needed (though the aim is to minimize this through forward-compatible design).
- [ ] Make any necessary minor adjustments to the V1 Firestore storage approach (if feasible without major rework of Step #16) to improve forward compatibility.

## Notes/Considerations:
*   This is primarily a design validation and due diligence step.
*   The goal is to avoid significant data restructuring or complex data migration scripts when moving from the simplified V1 plan management to the full dynamic plan management in Phase 2.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 4-8h) is for the review, comparison, documentation of findings, and any minor, immediate adjustments. If major incompatibilities are found, it would require re-scoping parts of Step #16.
*   This task item was extracted from a sub-bullet of the previous roadmap item ("Plan Management (Simplified V1)") by the parsing script. It's tightly coupled with that implementation.
