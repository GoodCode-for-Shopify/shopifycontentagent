# 8. Admin Dashboard (Shell & Auth): Basic layout/navigation for Admin Dashboard

**Parent Index:** [Content Agent Build Steps Index](index.md)

## Referenced TDDs/Documentation:
*   [Admin Dashboard: Frontend Development](../../jules/admin-dashboard/jules.admin-dashboard-development.md) (Section: "2. Core UI Components & Layout")

## Step Details:
This step focuses on creating the main application shell for the Admin Dashboard. This includes the overall page structure, primary navigation (sidebar or top bar), and the area where different views/pages will be rendered. This builds upon the React/Polaris project initialized in step 6 and the authentication implemented in step 7.

**Key Activities:**
*   Implement the main `App.jsx` (or equivalent) component to include the Polaris `AppProvider` and `Frame` components.
*   Design and implement a primary navigation structure using Polaris `Navigation` component. This will include links to the main sections of the admin dashboard (e.g., Dashboard Overview, Tenant Management, Plan Management, Settings).
*   Set up `react-router-dom` to render different page components within the main content area of the `Frame`.
*   Create placeholder components for the main dashboard pages that will be fleshed out in later steps.
*   Ensure the layout is responsive and works well on typical desktop screen sizes used by administrators.
*   Integrate the authentication state to, for example, display user information or a logout button in the top bar or navigation.

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] **Main App Component (`App.jsx` or similar):**
    - [ ] Ensure `AppProvider` wraps the entire application.
    - [ ] Implement the Polaris `Frame` component to provide the main structure (top bar, navigation, content area).
    - [ ] Include a TopBar component within the `Frame` (e.g., for search, user menu).
- [ ] **Navigation Component:**
    - [ ] Create a `NavigationMarkup` component using Polaris `Navigation` and `Navigation.Section`.
    - [ ] Define initial navigation links (e.g., "Dashboard", "Shops/Tenants", "Plans", "API Usage", "Settings"). Use `react-router-dom`'s `Link` component or a wrapper for navigation.
    - [ ] Integrate the `NavigationMarkup` into the `Frame`'s `navigation` prop.
- [ ] **Routing Setup (`react-router-dom`):**
    - [ ] Define routes for the main sections identified in the navigation.
    - [ ] Create basic placeholder page components for each route (e.g., `DashboardPage.jsx`, `TenantsPage.jsx`, `PlansPage.jsx`). These can just render a `Page` component with a title initially.
    - [ ] Ensure these page components are rendered within the content area of the `Frame`.
- [ ] **User Authentication Display:**
    - [ ] In the `TopBar` or `Navigation` user menu, display the logged-in admin's email or name.
    - [ ] Include a "Logout" button that calls the Firebase sign-out function.
- [ ] **Basic Styling & Layout:**
    - [ ] Ensure the overall layout is clean and functional using Polaris components.
    - [ ] Verify basic responsiveness.

## Notes/Considerations:
*   This step focuses on the shell. The content of each page linked from the navigation will be built in subsequent steps.
*   The exact navigation items might be refined as features are developed. Start with the primary sections identified in `docs/jules/admin-dashboard/jules.admin-dashboard-development.md`.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 4-8h) is for creating this structural shell and basic navigation wiring.
*   Consider how user roles (if implemented via custom claims like `isSuperAdmin`) might affect the visibility of certain navigation items in the future, though this is not part of the basic setup.
*   Loading states or skeleton pages can be considered for a better UX as data is fetched for different views later on.
