## Referenced TDDs/Documentation:
*   [Admin Dashboard: Infrastructure Setup](../../jules/admin-dashboard/jules.infrastructure-setup.md) (for context on developer-provided vs. tenant-provided keys)
*   [Server-Side and Database Setup](../../jules/serverside-setup.md) (Section: "Environment Variables for Firebase Functions" - how these keys are stored for backend use)
*   [Admin Dashboard: Backend Development](../../jules/admin-dashboard/jules.backend-development.md) (This will require new backend endpoints if admins are to *update* these keys via UI. If read-only or managed via CLI config, backend changes might be minimal).

## Step Details:
This step involves creating a UI in the Admin Dashboard for managing global, developer-provided API keys that the application might use by default for certain services or plan tiers (e.g., a global Gemini AI API key, a global Google API Key if not using tenant-specific ones for certain features).

**Important Note:** Storing and managing these keys requires extreme care. The UI should **never display existing key values**. It should only allow updating them or show their configuration status (e.g., "Set" or "Not Set"). The actual keys are stored as secure Firebase environment configurations or in Google Cloud Secret Manager, not directly in Firestore visible to the admin UI.

**Key Activities:**
*   **Backend (Cloud Functions - Express App):**
    *   Determine if admins will update these keys via the UI.
        *   **If Yes (Update via UI - more complex & higher security implications):** Requires a secure backend endpoint that can receive a new key value, validate admin permissions, and then update the Firebase Function's environment configuration (e.g., `firebase functions:config:set service.key=NEW_KEY`). This is programmatically complex and risky; direct CLI updates by authorized personnel are safer.
        *   **If No (Status View Only / Update via CLI - V1 Recommendation):** Backend might only provide status (e.g., "Gemini AI Key: Configured") without exposing values or update capability from UI. Updates would be done by developers directly via Firebase CLI: `firebase functions:config:set myservice.apikey="THE_KEY"`.
    *   For V1, it's strongly recommended to **limit UI functionality to displaying status (key is set/not set)** and require CLI for actual key updates.
*   **Frontend (Admin Dashboard - React/Polaris):**
    *   Develop a "Global API Keys" or "System Configuration" page.
    *   For each global key (e.g., "Developer Gemini AI Key", "Developer Google API Key"):
        *   Display the service name.
        *   Display its configuration status (e.g., "Configured" or "Not Configured"). This status could be fetched from a backend endpoint that checks if `functions.config().someservice.key` exists.
        *   Provide a `TextField` to input a *new* key value (only if UI updates are supported, otherwise this is a "Set New Key" action that guides to CLI).
        *   A "Save/Update" button for each key (if UI updates supported).
    *   Clear instructions and warnings about the sensitivity of these keys and the impact of changing them.

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] **Decision: UI Key Updates vs. CLI-Only Updates:**
    - [ ] Confirm if V1 will allow admins to update global API keys via the dashboard UI or if updates are strictly CLI-based by developers. (Recommendation: CLI-based for V1 for security and simplicity).
- [ ] **Backend API Endpoint(s) (if any needed beyond status):**
    - [ ] (If UI updates allowed) Design and implement a highly secure endpoint to update Firebase Function environment configurations. This is an advanced task and needs careful security review.
    - [ ] (More likely for V1) Implement an endpoint that returns the *status* of configured global keys (e.g., `GET /api/admin/config/global-keys-status` which checks `functions.config()` on the server and returns `{ geminiKeySet: true, googleApiKeySet: false }`).
- [ ] **Frontend (Admin Dashboard UI):**
    - [ ] Create a new page/route for "Global API Key Management" or similar.
    - [ ] Add a navigation link.
    - [ ] For each relevant global API key:
        - [ ] Display its friendly name (e.g., "Gemini AI API Key (Developer Account)").
        - [ ] Fetch and display its configuration status ("Set" / "Not Set") from the backend.
        - [ ] **If CLI-Only Updates (V1 Recommended):**
            - [ ] Provide clear instructions on how developers should update the key using `firebase functions:config:set ...` and then redeploy the relevant functions.
            - [ ] Optionally, a button to "Refresh Status" after a CLI update.
        - [ ] **If UI Updates are to be supported (Advanced):**
            - [ ] Add a `TextField` (password type if possible, though value is not stored/re-displayed) for inputting a new key.
            - [ ] Add an "Update Key" button.
            - [ ] On click, call the secure backend endpoint to update the key.
            - [ ] Display strong warnings about the impact of changing keys.
    - [ ] Provide prominent links to documentation for obtaining these API keys.

## Notes/Considerations:
*   **Security is paramount.** Exposing functionality to update live, global API keys via a web UI is high risk and should be approached with extreme caution, strong authentication, authorization, and audit logging. For V1, showing status and forcing CLI updates for the actual key values is much safer.
*   The "global API keys" are those used by the application itself when operating under a "developer-provided key" model for certain tenants/plans.
*   These are distinct from tenant-provided API keys, which users manage themselves.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 1-2d) assumes the V1 approach (status display, CLI for updates). Implementing secure UI-based updates for Firebase environment configs would be significantly more complex (3-5d+).
*   This UI serves as a reminder and status check for administrators/developers regarding critical system configurations.
