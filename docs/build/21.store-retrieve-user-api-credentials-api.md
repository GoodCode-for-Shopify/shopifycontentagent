## Step Details:
This step involves implementing the backend API endpoints that the Shopify App frontend will use to:
1.  Store new or updated user-provided third-party API credentials (e.g., their own Gemini AI key, Google Ads refresh token after OAuth).
2.  Enable the backend to retrieve these credentials for making API calls on behalf of the user (credentials are not sent back to the frontend).

These credentials must be encrypted before storage using the shared encryption utilities.

**Key Activities:**
*   **Backend (Cloud Functions - Express App):**
    *   **Store Credential Endpoint (e.g., `POST /api/credentials/:credentialType`):**
        *   Protected by `authenticateShopifyRequest` middleware (to get `shop_id`).
        *   Receives the credential type (e.g., `gemini_ai_api_key`, `google_ads_refresh_token`) from URL parameter and the credential value (and any associated non-sensitive identifiers like `customer_id`) from the request body.
        *   Validates the input.
        *   Calls the `encrypt` utility to encrypt the sensitive credential value.
        *   Stores the encrypted value and its IV (and any non-sensitive parts) in the appropriate structure within the `shops/{shop_id}` document in Firestore (e.g., `credentials.gemini_ai_api_key: { iv, encrypted_value }`).
        *   Includes logic to test the credential with the third-party API before saving (as described in the onboarding credential walkthrough).
    *   **Internal Retrieval Function (`getDecryptedCredential`):**
        *   This function (already detailed in `serverside-setup.md` and `build/14...encryption...md`) is used internally by other backend functions that need to make third-party API calls. It's not typically exposed as a direct GET endpoint for credentials to the frontend.
        *   It takes `shopId` and `credentialType` as input, fetches the encrypted data from Firestore, decrypts it, and returns it for server-side use.

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] **Backend API Endpoint (`POST /api/credentials/:credentialType`):**
    - [ ] Define or verify the route in the Express app (e.g., within `credentialsRouter` or `shopifyRouter`).
    - [ ] Ensure it's protected by `authenticateShopifyRequest` middleware.
    - [ ] Implement the logic:
        - [ ] Get `shop_id` from `req`.
        - [ ] Get `credentialType` from `req.params`.
        - [ ] Get `value` (and optional fields like `customer_id`) from `req.body`.
        - [ ] Perform input validation.
        - [ ] **Credential Test (Important):** Before saving, make a test call to the respective third-party API using the provided credential. If the test fails, return an error to the frontend and do not save. (This logic might be specific per credential type).
        - [ ] If the test succeeds, encrypt the `value` using the `encrypt` utility.
        - [ ] Construct the data to be stored (including `iv`, `encrypted_value`, and any non-sensitive parts).
        - [ ] Update the `shops/{shop_id}` document in Firestore with the credential data using `set({ merge: true })` to avoid overwriting other credentials. Use a dynamic path like `credentials.${credentialTypeKey}`.
        - [ ] Return a success response.
        - [ ] Implement robust error handling (validation errors, encryption errors, Firestore errors, API test errors).
- [ ] **Verify `getDecryptedCredential` Internal Function:**
    - [ ] Ensure this function (developed in Build Step #14) is accessible and functional for other backend services that will need to use these stored credentials.
- [ ] **Testing (`POST /api/credentials/:credentialType`):**
    - [ ] Test storing various credential types.
    - [ ] Verify credentials are encrypted correctly in Firestore (check `iv` and `encrypted_value` fields, not the plaintext).
    - [ ] Test the credential validation logic (e.g., provide a deliberately bad key and ensure it's rejected).
    - [ ] Test error handling for missing inputs, encryption failures.
    - [ ] Test with unauthenticated requests (expect 401/403).
- [ ] **OAuth Callbacks:**
    - [ ] For OAuth-based credentials (like Google Ads refresh token), ensure the OAuth callback endpoint (developed in Build Step #11) correctly uses this credential storage mechanism (encrypts and saves the token).

## Notes/Considerations:
*   The actual encryption/decryption utilities (`encrypt`, `decrypt`) and the `getDecryptedCredential` function should have been implemented in Build Step #14. This step focuses on the API endpoint for *storing* credentials provided by the user via the Shopify App UI and ensuring the retrieval mechanism is ready for other backend services.
*   **Security:** The frontend should NEVER receive decrypted sensitive credentials. The `getDecryptedCredential` function is for backend internal use only.
*   The `credentialType` in the route parameter should map to a consistent key used in the Firestore document (e.g., `gemini_ai_api_key`, `google_ads_refresh_token`).
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 1-2d) is for implementing the `POST` endpoint, including input validation, the pre-save API test call logic for a couple of credential types, and thorough testing.
*   The pre-save API test call is crucial for good UX, as it immediately tells the user if the credential they provided is invalid. This might require helper functions for each credential type to perform its specific validation call.
*   Error responses should follow the Global API Error Handling Strategy.
