*   [Environments and CI/CD Strategy](../../jules/environments-and-cicd-strategy.md) (Section: "Environment Strategy", "Firebase Project Aliases")
*   [Jules Authority Document](../../jules.authority.md) (Directive: "Multi-Environment Strategy")

## Step Details:
This step involves the initial creation and configuration of the Firebase projects that will serve the different environments (Development, Staging, Production) for the "Content Agent" application. It includes enabling core services like Firestore, Cloud Functions, Firebase Hosting, and Firebase Authentication for each project.

**Key Activities based on the Multi-Environment Strategy:**

*   **Create Separate Firebase Projects:**
    *   One for Development (e.g., `content-agent-dev`)
    *   One for Staging (e.g., `content-agent-staging`)
    *   One for Production (e.g., `content-agent-prod`)
*   **For each Firebase project:**
    *   Link to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project.
    *   Enable Firestore database (Production mode rules, select location).
    *   Enable Firebase Hosting.
    *   Enable Firebase Authentication (configure sign-in methods later as per specific app needs - e.g., Email/Password & Google for Admin; Shopify for the app itself is via backend token verification).
    *   Initialize Firebase Functions (Node.js runtime, e.g., Node.js 18).
*   **Firebase CLI Project Aliases:**
    *   Configure Firebase CLI aliases for easy switching between projects (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `prod`) using `.firebaserc`.

## Action Items/Checklist:

*   **Production Environment Firebase Project (`content-agent-prod` or similar):**
    *   [ ] Create Firebase project in the Firebase Console.
    *   [ ] Link to the designated production GCP project.
    *   [ ] Enable Firestore (Production mode, choose region).
    *   [ ] Enable Firebase Hosting.
    *   [ ] Enable Firebase Authentication.
    *   [ ] Initialize Firebase Functions locally for this project context (even if code is shared, initial setup might differ slightly or confirm settings).
    *   [ ] Set up `prod` alias in `.firebaserc`.
*   **Staging Environment Firebase Project (`content-agent-staging` or similar):**
    *   [ ] Create Firebase project.
    *   [ ] Link to a staging/testing GCP project.
    *   [ ] Enable Firestore (Production mode rules, choose region).
    *   [ ] Enable Firebase Hosting.
    *   [ ] Enable Firebase Authentication.
    *   [ ] Initialize Firebase Functions.
    *   [ ] Set up `staging` alias in `.firebaserc`.
*   **Development Environment Firebase Project (`content-agent-dev` or similar):**
    *   [ ] Create Firebase project.
    *   [ ] Link to a development/sandbox GCP project.
    *   [ ] Enable Firestore (Test mode rules initially acceptable, or Production mode; choose region).
    *   [ ] Enable Firebase Hosting.
    *   [ ] Enable Firebase Authentication.
    *   [ ] Initialize Firebase Functions.
    *   [ ] Set up `dev` alias in `.firebaserc`.
*   **Local Project Configuration:**
    *   [ ] Ensure the local project's `.firebaserc` file correctly maps aliases (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`) to the respective Firebase Project IDs.
    *   [ ] Test Firebase CLI project switching: `firebase use dev`, `firebase use staging`, `firebase use prod`.

## Notes/Considerations:
*   Refer to `docs/jules/serverside-setup.md` for detailed steps on enabling Firestore, Hosting, and initializing Functions. This build step applies those instructions across multiple Firebase projects.
*   The chosen GCP project regions for Firebase services (Firestore, Functions) should be consistent where possible, or chosen strategically for each environment. This cannot be changed later for Firestore.
*   Billing must be enabled on the underlying GCP projects for all Firebase projects that will use services requiring the Blaze plan (e.g., Cloud Functions with outbound networking, 2nd Gen Functions). This is covered in the next step.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 2-4h) is for the creation and basic enablement of services across the multiple Firebase projects. Detailed configuration of each service (rules, specific function code, hosting content) will occur in subsequent steps.
*   Ensure project naming conventions are clear (e.g., `yourproject-dev`, `yourproject-staging`, `yourproject-prod`).
