# 1. General: Finalize Core Technology Choices

**Parent Index:** [Content Agent Build Steps Index](index.md)

---

## Referenced TDDs/Documentation:
*   [Jules Authority Document](../../jules.authority.md)

## Step Details:
The core technology choices for the "Content Agent" project are largely defined in the `docs/jules.authority.md` document. This step involves a final review and confirmation of these choices before proceeding with further setup.

**Key Technologies Confirmed:**
*   **Frontend:** React, Shopify Polaris
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Cloud Functions for Firebase (2nd Gen)
*   **Python PAA Service:** Python, Cloud Functions for Firebase or Google Cloud Run
*   **Database:** Firestore
*   **Hosting:** Firebase Hosting
*   **Authentication:** Shopify Session Tokens (for app-backend), Firebase Authentication (for Admin Dashboard)

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] Review `docs/jules.authority.md` Section 1 (Core Technology Stack) with the development team.
- [ ] Confirm no outstanding concerns or necessary changes to the core stack.
- [ ] Document any minor clarifications or final decisions here if they arose during the review.

## Notes/Considerations:
*   Ensure all team members are aligned with these technology choices.
*   Any deviations from `jules.authority.md` must be discussed, justified, and documented therein.
*   This step is primarily a checkpoint. Most of the "work" (decision-making) is already captured in the authority document.
*   The placeholder time estimate for this step (e.g., 1-2h) is for this final review and confirmation.
