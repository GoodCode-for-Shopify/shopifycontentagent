## Step Details:
This step involves creating a backend API endpoint for AI image generation. This feature is plan-dependent and allows users to generate images based on prompts or suggestions, typically derived from article outlines. For MVP/Phase 1, this is considered optional but is included here as a defined step from the roadmap.

**Key Activities:**
*   **Backend (Cloud Functions - Express App):**
    *   Define a new route, e.g., `POST /api/content/generate-image`.
    *   This endpoint must be protected by the `authenticateShopifyRequest` middleware.
    *   **Logic:**
        1.  Accepts an image prompt/suggestion and potentially an `articleId` (if associating images with a specific article in the `job_articles` collection).
        2.  Fetch the current shop's plan features (Build Step #20). Check if `aiImageGeneration.enabled` is true and if any `monthlyLimit` needs to be considered (usage tracking is a separate step but flag for it here). If not enabled, return an error/appropriate message.
        3.  Determine which AI Image Generation API key to use (developer-provided or tenant-provided, based on plan/credentials, similar to other AI services - Build Step #25).
        4.  Construct a prompt for the chosen AI image generation service (e.g., Imagen via Vertex AI, DALL-E API, Stable Diffusion).
        5.  Make the API call to the image generation service. This service will typically return image URLs (e.g., to temporary cloud storage) or image data.
        6.  If an `articleId` was provided and images are selected by the user (this API might return options, selection is a frontend concern often followed by another call or update): update the `job_articles` document with image URLs/references and status. For this initial generation API, it might just return image URLs.
        7.  Return the generated image URLs or data for options to the frontend.

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] **Choose AI Image Generation Service:**
    - [ ] Decide on the initial AI image generation provider (e.g., Vertex AI Imagen, third-party API).
    - [ ] Obtain necessary API keys for the chosen service (developer key).
- [ ] **API Credential Handling Logic:**
    - [ ] Implement logic for selecting developer vs. tenant-provided keys for the image generation service, if applicable (similar to Build Step #25).
- [ ] **Backend API Endpoint (`POST /api/content/generate-image`):**
    - [ ] Define the route in the Express app.
    - [ ] Apply `authenticateShopifyRequest` middleware.
    - [ ] **Core Logic:**
        - [ ] Get `shop_id` from `req`.
        - [ ] Get `prompt` (and optional `articleId`, `image_suggestion_details`) from `req.body`.
        - [ ] Fetch shop's plan features. If AI image generation is not enabled by the plan, return an appropriate error.
        - [ ] (Consider `monthlyLimit` from plan features - actual enforcement might be part of a separate API usage tracking/quota system, but the flag to check is here).
        - [ ] Retrieve the appropriate AI Image Generation API key. Handle missing/invalid keys.
        - [ ] Construct the prompt for the image generation API based on `prompt` from request.
        - [ ] Make the API call to the image generation service.
        - [ ] Process the response (e.g., list of image URLs or data for 2-3 variants).
        - [ ] Return the image URLs/data to the frontend.
        - [ ] (Deferring Firestore updates for `job_articles.selectedImageUrls` to a potential subsequent "save image selection" step, or integrate if API generates final images directly).
    - [ ] Implement error handling (AI service errors, credential errors, plan limit errors) using the global API error handling strategy.
- [ ] **Testing:**
    - [ ] Test with valid prompts and an available API key.
    - [ ] Verify the format of returned image data/URLs.
    - [ ] Test with plans where image generation is disabled.
    - [ ] Test error handling for AI service failures or invalid prompts.
    - [ ] Test with unauthenticated requests.

## Notes/Considerations:
*   This feature is marked as optional for MVP in the roadmap, so its implementation might be deferred.
*   The choice of image generation AI provider will impact API integration details and cost.
*   Image URLs returned by AI services might be temporary. A strategy for long-term storage (e.g., Firebase Storage, or uploading to Shopify CDN during commit phase - Build Step #30) is crucial and detailed in `docs/jules/shopify-app/jules.article-construction-and-imaging.md`. This API step focuses on *generation*.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 2-3d) depends heavily on the chosen image AI provider and the complexity of the API.
*   API usage for image generation needs to be tracked against plan limits (e.g., `aiImageGeneration.monthlyLimit`) and for developer-provided key billing.
*   The frontend will display these images as options; user selection might trigger another backend call to finalize which images are associated with an article, or this API might generate a single final image based on a very specific prompt. The TDD `jules.article-construction-and-imaging.md` suggests returning options.
*   Consider content moderation for generated images if prompts are user-influenced.
