# 14. Shared Backend Logic: Implement credential encryption/decryption utilities (Node.js `crypto`)

**Parent Index:** [Content Agent Build Steps Index](index.md)

## Referenced TDDs/Documentation:
*   [Server-Side and Database Setup](../../jules/serverside-setup.md) (Section: "Credential Management - Server-Side", subsection "1. Encryption and Decryption Utilities")
*   [Jules Authority Document](../../jules.authority.md) (Directive: "Credential Management (Third-Party APIs for Tenants)")
*   Node.js `crypto` module documentation.

## Step Details:
This step focuses on creating and testing the shared utility functions for encrypting and decrypting sensitive credentials (e.g., API keys, refresh tokens) using Node.js's built-in `crypto` module. These utilities will be used by the backend Cloud Functions to ensure that credentials stored in Firestore are encrypted at rest. AES-256 is the chosen algorithm.

**Key Activities:**
*   Create a dedicated JavaScript module (e.g., `functions/src/encryption.js` or a shared lib folder if structuring for multiple backend services).
*   Implement `encrypt(text)` and `decrypt(encryptedData, ivHex)` functions as detailed in `docs/jules/serverside-setup.md`.
    *   Ensure the use of `aes-256-cbc` algorithm.
    *   Correctly handle Initialization Vectors (IVs) - generate a unique IV for each encryption and store it alongside the encrypted data.
    *   Manage the primary encryption key securely via Firebase environment configuration (`functions.config().secrets.encryption_key`) or Google Cloud Secret Manager. **The key must not be hardcoded.**
*   Thoroughly test these utility functions.

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] **Create `encryption.js` (or similar utility module):**
    - [ ] In the `functions/src/` directory (or a shared backend utilities path).
- [ ] **Implement `encrypt` function:**
    - [ ] Takes plaintext as input.
    - [ ] Retrieves the master encryption key securely (from Firebase config/Secret Manager).
    - [ ] Generates a random 16-byte Initialization Vector (IV).
    - [ ] Uses `crypto.createCipheriv` with `aes-256-cbc`, the master key, and the IV.
    - [ ] Returns an object containing `{ iv: iv.toString('hex'), encryptedData: encrypted.toString('hex') }`.
    - [ ] Include robust error handling (e.g., if encryption key is missing).
- [ ] **Implement `decrypt` function:**
    - [ ] Takes an object `{ encryptedData: '...', iv: '...' }` (or separate `encryptedData` and `ivHex` strings) as input.
    - [ ] Retrieves the master encryption key securely.
    - [ ] Uses `crypto.createDecipheriv` with `aes-256-cbc`, the master key, and the provided IV (converted from hex).
    - [ ] Returns the decrypted plaintext string.
    - [ ] Include robust error handling (e.g., if key is missing, or if decryption fails due to incorrect IV/key/data).
- [ ] **Encryption Key Management:**
    - [ ] **Generate a strong, random 32-byte (256-bit) encryption key.** Represent it as a 64-character hexadecimal string.
    - [ ] **Set up Firebase Environment Configuration for the key:**
        - For local emulation: Add to `functions/.runtimeconfig.json` (e.g., `{"secrets":{"encryption_key":"YOUR_64_CHAR_HEX_KEY"}}`) and ensure this file is in `.gitignore`.
        - For deployed environments (dev, staging, prod Firebase projects): Set using Firebase CLI: `firebase functions:config:set secrets.encryption_key="YOUR_64_CHAR_HEX_KEY"`. This needs to be done for each Firebase project.
    - [ ] Ensure the `encryption.js` module correctly attempts to load the key from `functions.config().secrets.encryption_key`.
- [ ] **Testing:**
    - [ ] Write unit tests for `encrypt` and `decrypt`:
        - [ ] Test that encrypting and then decrypting a string returns the original string.
        - [ ] Test edge cases (e.g., empty string).
        - [ ] Test that decryption fails with an incorrect IV or key (if feasible to simulate in tests).
        - [ ] Test behavior when the encryption key is not configured.
    - [ ] Ensure tests can run locally (potentially mocking `functions.config()` or using a test key specifically for unit tests if direct config access is problematic in test environment).

## Notes/Considerations:
*   The detailed code for these functions is provided in `docs/jules/serverside-setup.md`. This step is about implementing and rigorously testing that code.
*   Security of the primary encryption key is paramount. Using Firebase environment configuration (which leverages Google Cloud Secret Manager for 2nd Gen functions implicitly for build-time config) is a good practice.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 4-8h) includes careful implementation, setting up key management for local dev vs. deployed envs, and writing thorough unit tests.
*   These utilities are fundamental to the security of stored credentials and will be used in subsequent steps when implementing API endpoints for saving credentials.
*   Ensure consistent error handling within these utilities (e.g., throwing specific error types if the key is unavailable).
