# 6. Admin Dashboard (Shell & Auth): Initialize React/Polaris project for Admin Dashboard

**Parent Index:** [Content Agent Build Steps Index](index.md)

## Referenced TDDs/Documentation:
*   [Admin Dashboard: Frontend Development](../../jules/admin-dashboard/jules.admin-dashboard-development.md) (Section: "1. Frontend Project Setup")
*   [Environments and CI/CD Strategy](../../jules/environments-and-cicd-strategy.md) (for context on different environments, though this step is about initial local setup)

## Step Details:
This step involves initializing the React project for the Admin Dashboard frontend. This will be a Single Page Application (SPA) built using React and Shopify Polaris components, eventually hosted on Firebase Hosting.

**Key Activities:**
*   Use a standard React project generator like Create React App or Vite to scaffold the application in the designated frontend directory (e.g., `admin-dashboard-ui/`).
*   Install Shopify Polaris and its peer dependencies.
*   Set up basic Firebase SDK configuration for the frontend (to be used later for Firebase Authentication).
*   Configure Firebase Hosting in `firebase.json` to serve the build output of this React application, including rewrites for API calls and SPA routing.

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] Navigate to the chosen parent directory for frontend projects.
- [ ] Initialize a new React application using Vite (recommended) or Create React App:
    - `npm create vite@latest admin-dashboard-ui -- --template react` (and `npm install`)
    - OR `npx create-react-app admin-dashboard-ui`
- [ ] Change into the newly created `admin-dashboard-ui` directory.
- [ ] Install Shopify Polaris: `npm install @shopify/polaris @shopify/app-bridge-react` (Note: App Bridge might be optional if not embedding, but Polaris is used for UI).
- [ ] Install `react-router-dom` for client-side routing: `npm install react-router-dom`.
- [ ] Install Firebase SDK for frontend: `npm install firebase`.
- [ ] Create an initial `src/firebaseConfig.js` file with placeholders for Firebase project configuration (to be populated per environment later, possibly via `.env` files).
- [ ] Update the main `firebase.json` in the project root:
    - [ ] Add/confirm a hosting target for the admin dashboard (e.g., `admin-dashboard`).
    - [ ] Set the `public` directory to the build output of the React app (e.g., `admin-dashboard-ui/dist` for Vite, `admin-dashboard-ui/build` for CRA).
    - [ ] Configure necessary `rewrites` (one for API calls to `/api/admin/**` to the backend function, and one for `**` to `/index.html` for SPA routing).
- [ ] Create a basic `App.jsx` or `App.js` structure:
    - [ ] Include Polaris `AppProvider`.
    - [ ] Set up basic `BrowserRouter` from `react-router-dom`.
- [ ] Ensure the `admin-dashboard-ui` directory is correctly placed within the overall project structure and committed to Git.

## Notes/Considerations:
*   Refer to `docs/jules/admin-dashboard/jules.admin-dashboard-development.md` for specific examples of `firebase.json` configuration and `firebaseConfig.js` setup.
*   The decision between Vite and Create React App should be made based on team familiarity and project needs (Vite is generally faster for development).
*   While `@shopify/app-bridge-react` is installed with Polaris, its direct use might be minimal if the admin dashboard is not an embedded Shopify App. Polaris components are used for their UI/UX.
*   Environment-specific Firebase configurations for `firebaseConfig.js` will be handled via `.env` files and CI/CD environment variables during the build process for different environments (dev, staging, prod). For local development, a `.env.local` can be used.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 2-4h) is for scaffolding the project, installing core dependencies, and initial Firebase Hosting configuration in `firebase.json`.
