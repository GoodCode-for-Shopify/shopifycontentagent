## Step Details:
This step involves building the main user interface for content creation within the Shopify App. For the MVP (Phase 1), this will be a multi-step form that guides the user through a "single-pass" or "single article" generation flow. The more complex "Article Workspace" for multi-article management is deferred to Phase 2.

**Key Activities:**
*   **Develop React/Polaris Components for each step of the flow:**
    *   **Step 1: Product Selection:** UI to select a Shopify product (e.g., using Shopify App Bridge `ResourcePicker` or calling the backend product search/validation API - Build Step #24).
    *   **Step 2: Keyword Generation:** UI to trigger keyword generation based on the selected product, display suggested keywords, and allow user selection. Calls API from Build Step #25.
    *   **Step 3: Related Questions (Plan-Dependent):** UI to trigger PAA question fetching based on selected keywords, display questions, and allow user selection. Calls API from Build Step #26. UI elements should be conditional based on plan features (from Build Step #20).
    *   **Step 4: Article Outline Generation:** UI to trigger outline generation based on all previous inputs. Display the generated outline (title, H1s, H2s, image suggestions). Allow for basic review (editing deferred or simplified for MVP). Calls API from Build Step #27.
    *   **Step 5: Article Construction:** UI to trigger full article text construction based on the outline. Display the generated text in a viewer or simple editor. Calls API from Build Step #28.
    *   **Step 6: AI Image Generation (Optional for MVP):** If included, UI to display image suggestions from outline, trigger AI image generation for selected suggestions, and allow user to pick images. Calls API from Build Step #29. Conditional based on plan.
    *   **Step 7: Commit/Export:** UI to allow user to commit the article to Shopify blog (as draft) or download as MD/TXT. Calls APIs from Build Step #30 and #31.
*   **Overall Flow Management:**
    *   A parent component to manage the current step in the form, data persistence between steps (client-side state).
    *   Clear navigation (Next/Previous buttons).
    *   Display progress.
*   **Plan Limit Awareness:** The UI should be aware of the user's plan limits (fetched via API from Build Step #20) and potentially disable or modify UI elements accordingly (e.g., number of keywords selectable, availability of "Related Questions" or "AI Image Generation").

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] **Parent Flow Component:**
    - [ ] Create a component to manage the overall multi-step form state (current step, accumulated data).
    - [ ] Implement "Next" and "Previous" step navigation logic.
- [ ] **Step 1: Product Selection UI:**
    - [ ] Implement UI for product selection. Consider using Shopify App Bridge `ResourcePicker` for a native experience.
    - [ ] If using ResourcePicker, handle its output (product IDs).
    - [ ] If building custom search, integrate with the backend product search/validation API (Build Step #24).
    - [ ] Store selected product data in the flow state.
- [ ] **Step 2: Keyword Generation UI:**
    - [ ] UI to display selected product info.
    - [ ] Button to trigger keyword generation (calls API from Build Step #25).
    - [ ] Display returned keywords with checkboxes for selection.
    - [ ] Respect `keywordGenerationLimit` from plan features.
    - [ ] Store selected keywords.
- [ ] **Step 3: Related Questions UI (Conditional):**
    - [ ] Check plan features: if `relatedQuestions.enabled` is false, this step may be skipped or show a "feature not available" message.
    - [ ] If enabled: UI to display selected keywords. Button to fetch PAA questions (calls API from Build Step #26).
    - [ ] Display returned questions with checkboxes. Respect `maxQuestionsToRetrieve`.
    - [ ] Store selected questions.
- [ ] **Step 4: Article Outline Generation UI:**
    - [ ] UI to display current inputs (product, keywords, PAA).
    - [ ] Button to generate outline (calls API from Build Step #27).
    - [ ] Display the structured outline (H1, H2s, etc.). MVP might not include editing features for the outline.
    - [ ] Store generated outline.
- [ ] **Step 5: Article Text Construction UI:**
    - [ ] UI to display the approved/generated outline.
    - [ ] Button to construct full article text (calls API from Build Step #28).
    - [ ] Display generated HTML text in a read-only view or a very basic editor.
    - [ ] Store constructed text.
- [ ] **Step 6: AI Image Generation UI (Optional MVP & Conditional):**
    - [ ] Check plan features for `aiImageGeneration.enabled`.
    - [ ] If enabled: UI to show image suggestions (from outline). Buttons to generate images for suggestions (calls API from Build Step #29).
    - [ ] Display generated image options, allow selection. Store selected image references.
- [ ] **Step 7: Commit/Export UI:**
    - [ ] Buttons: "Commit to Shopify Blog (Draft)", "Download as Markdown", "Download as Text".
    - [ ] "Commit" calls API from Build Step #30.
    - [ ] "Download" calls API from Build Step #31, triggering file download.
    - [ ] Display success/error messages.
- [ ] **General UI/UX:**
    - [ ] Implement loading indicators for all API calls.
    - [ ] Consistent error display using Polaris components.
    - [ ] Ensure a clear sense of progress through the steps.
- [ ] **Testing:**
    - [ ] Test the complete end-to-end single article flow with various inputs and options.
    - [ ] Verify plan limits are respected in the UI (e.g., disabling features, limiting selections).
    - [ ] Test all API integrations and their error handling.

## Notes/Considerations:
*   This is the core user-facing feature for MVP. User experience should be as intuitive as possible.
*   The "single-pass" nature means that if a user goes back to a previous step and makes changes, the subsequent steps' data will likely need to be cleared and regenerated.
*   State management for the data accumulated across steps (product info, keywords, PAA, outline, text, images) needs careful consideration (e.g., React Context or a simple state management library for this flow).
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 3-5d) is for building these multiple UI views, integrating their respective API calls, and managing the flow state. This is a significant piece of UI work.
*   This UI will be significantly refactored/enhanced in Phase 2 when the "Article Workspace" and multi-article processing are introduced. This MVP version prioritizes getting a single article generated end-to-end.
*   Accessibility (a11y) should be considered, leveraging Polaris components' built-in accessibility features.
