## Referenced TDDs/Documentation:
*   [Shopify App: Authentication & Onboarding](../../jules/shopify-app/jules.authentication-and-onboarding.md) (Initial credential walkthrough provides context)
*   [Shopify App Backend: Store/Retrieve User API Credentials API](21.store-retrieve-user-api-credentials-api.md) (The backend API this UI will primarily interact with for saving credentials)
*   [Server-Side and Database Setup](../../jules/serverside-setup.md) (For context on how credentials are encrypted and stored, and for OAuth redirect URIs if re-authentication is triggered)

## Step Details:
This step involves creating a settings page within the Shopify App frontend where users can view the status of their third-party API credentials and update them if necessary. This is distinct from the initial onboarding credential walkthrough and provides ongoing management capability.

**Key Activities:**
*   **React/Polaris UI Development:**
    *   Create a new "Settings" or "API Credentials" page within the Shopify App.
    *   For each credential type that the user can provide (e.g., Gemini AI API Key, Google API Key, Google Ads Refresh Token):
        *   Display the credential type and its current status (e.g., "Set," "Not Set," "Requires Re-authentication"). The status would be fetched from a backend endpoint that checks for the presence/validity of stored credentials without exposing the credentials themselves.
        *   Provide a `TextField` (or appropriate input) for the user to enter/update the credential value.
        *   A "Save & Test" or "Update" button that calls the backend API (`POST /api/credentials/:credentialType` - from Build Step #21) to validate and save the new credential.
        *   For OAuth-based credentials (like Google Ads), instead of a direct input field for the token, provide a "Reconnect" or "Re-authorize with Google" button. This button would redirect the user to the backend OAuth initiation endpoint (e.g., `/api/oauth/google/initiate` - from Build Step #11).
    *   Display success/error feedback from the backend API calls.
*   **Backend API Interaction:**
    *   The primary interaction is with the `POST /api/credentials/:credentialType` endpoint to save updated credentials.
    *   A new backend endpoint might be needed to fetch the *status* of currently configured credentials for a shop (e.g., `GET /api/credentials/status`) to populate the settings page without sending any sensitive values to the frontend.

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] **Backend API Endpoint for Credential Status (Optional but Recommended):**
    - [ ] Design and implement `GET /api/credentials/status` (or similar).
        - [ ] Protected by `authenticateShopifyRequest`.
        - [ ] Fetches the `shops/{shop_id}` document.
        - [ ] Returns a map of credential types and their status (e.g., `{ gemini_ai_api_key: "set", google_ads_refresh_token: "not_set" }`).
- [ ] **Frontend Settings Page UI:**
    - [ ] Create a new page component (e.g., `CredentialsSettingsPage.jsx`).
    - [ ] Add a route and navigation link for this page.
    - [ ] On page load, call the new `GET /api/credentials/status` endpoint to display current statuses.
    - [ ] For each user-configurable credential:
        - [ ] Display its name and current status.
        - [ ] **For direct input keys (e.g., Gemini AI API Key):**
            - [ ] Provide a `TextField` (initially empty or with a placeholder like "••••••••••••••••").
            - [ ] Add a "Save" or "Update & Test" button. On click, call `POST /api/credentials/:credentialType` with the new value.
            - [ ] Display success/error messages from the API. Update status display on success.
        - [ ] **For OAuth-based credentials (e.g., Google Ads Refresh Token):**
            - [ ] Display status (e.g., "Connected" or "Not Connected / Reconnect needed").
            - [ ] Provide a "Connect/Reconnect with Google" button that navigates the user to the backend OAuth initiation URL (e.g., `/api/oauth/google/initiate`).
    - [ ] Ensure clear instructions and links to documentation for obtaining each key.
- [ ] **Testing:**
    - [ ] Test viewing credential statuses.
    - [ ] Test updating a direct input API key (verify it's saved, old one overwritten).
    - [ ] Test the re-authentication flow for an OAuth-based credential.
    - [ ] Test error handling for invalid keys or API failures during save/test.

## Notes/Considerations:
*   **Security:** As with onboarding, the frontend should never store or re-display existing sensitive credential values. Input fields should be for new values only.
*   The backend API for saving credentials (`POST /api/credentials/:credentialType`) from Build Step #21, which includes a test call before saving, is heavily reused here.
*   The OAuth initiation endpoint from Build Step #11 is reused for re-authentication.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 1-2d) is for creating the settings UI, integrating the status-fetching API, and wiring up the existing save/OAuth initiation calls.
*   This page provides ongoing management for users who might need to update keys if they expire, are revoked, or if they skipped optional ones during onboarding.
*   Clear visual feedback on the success or failure of updating/testing credentials is very important for user experience.
