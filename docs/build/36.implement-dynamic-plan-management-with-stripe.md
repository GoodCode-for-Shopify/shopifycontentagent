## Referenced TDDs/Documentation:
*   [Admin Dashboard: Technical Design - Dynamic Plan Management & Stripe Integration](../../jules/admin-dashboard/tech-design.dynamic-plans-stripe.md) (Primary TDD for this feature)
*   [Admin Dashboard: Infrastructure Setup](../../jules/admin-dashboard/jules.infrastructure-setup.md) (Stripe configuration, `plans` schema)
*   [Admin Dashboard: Backend Development](../../jules/admin-dashboard/jules.backend-development.md) (Admin API routes for plans)
*   [Admin Dashboard: Frontend Development](../../jules/admin-dashboard/jules.admin-dashboard-development.md) (Plan Configuration Interface UI)
*   Stripe API Documentation (for Products, Prices, etc.)

## Step Details:
This step involves implementing the full dynamic plan management feature in the Admin Dashboard, including deep integration with Stripe for creating and managing Stripe Products and Prices. This is a significant enhancement from the simplified V1 plan management (Build Step #16) and aligns with Phase 2 of the roadmap.

**Key Activities:**
*   **Backend (Cloud Functions - Express App):**
    *   Implement/update the Admin API endpoints for plan management (`POST /api/admin/plans`, `GET /api/admin/plans`, `GET /api/admin/plans/:planId`, `PUT /api/admin/plans/:planId`, `DELETE /api/admin/plans/:planId`) as detailed in `tech-design.dynamic-plans-stripe.md`.
    *   **Stripe Integration Logic:**
        *   When creating a plan: Create a Stripe Product and a Stripe Price. Store their IDs in Firestore.
        *   When updating a plan's pricing: Archive the old Stripe Price and create a new one. Update IDs in Firestore.
        *   When updating other plan details (name, description): Update the Stripe Product if necessary.
        *   When archiving a plan: Archive the Stripe Price. Optionally archive the Stripe Product if no other active prices use it.
    *   Use the official Stripe Node.js library.
    *   Securely manage Stripe API secret keys (via Firebase environment config).
*   **Frontend (Admin Dashboard - React/Polaris):**
    *   Develop the full "Plan Configuration Interface" as described in `jules.admin-dashboard.admin-dashboard-development.md` and `tech-design.dynamic-plans-stripe.md`.
    *   UI for listing plans (with Stripe IDs visible).
    *   Forms for creating and editing plans, including fields for name, description, price, currency, interval, and all feature limits defined in the `plans` schema.
    *   Logic to call the updated backend APIs for CRUD operations on plans.
    *   Clear display of plan status (active, archived).
    *   Confirmation modals for destructive actions (archiving).

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] **Stripe Setup:**
    - [ ] Ensure Stripe account is active and API keys (secret key for backend) are available in Firebase environment configuration for dev, staging, and eventually production.
- [ ] **Backend API Endpoints (Full Implementation):**
    - [ ] **`POST /api/admin/plans` (Create):**
        - [ ] Validate input.
        - [ ] Create Stripe Product (store `planId` in metadata).
        - [ ] Create Stripe Price (store `planId` in metadata).
        - [ ] Save plan to Firestore with Stripe IDs.
    - [ ] **`GET /api/admin/plans` & `GET /api/admin/plans/:planId` (Read):**
        - [ ] Fetch and return plans from Firestore.
    - [ ] **`PUT /api/admin/plans/:planId` (Update):**
        - [ ] Validate input. Fetch existing plan.
        - [ ] If pricing (amount, currency, interval) changes: Archive old Stripe Price, create new Stripe Price, update Firestore with new `stripePriceId` and add old to `legacyPriceIds`.
        - [ ] If plan name/description changes: Update Stripe Product.
        - [ ] Update other plan details in Firestore.
    - [ ] **`DELETE /api/admin/plans/:planId` (Archive):**
        - [ ] Update plan status to "archived" in Firestore.
        - [ ] Archive the Stripe Price.
        - [ ] (Optional V1) Logic to archive Stripe Product if no other prices are attached.
    - [ ] Ensure all endpoints use `adminAuthMiddleware`.
    - [ ] Implement robust error handling for Stripe API calls and Firestore operations.
- [ ] **Frontend (Admin Dashboard UI - Plan Configuration):**
    - [ ] **Plan List Page:**
        - [ ] Display plans from `GET /api/admin/plans`.
        - [ ] Show key details including Stripe IDs (for admin reference), status.
        - [ ] "Add New Plan" button. Actions for "Edit", "Archive".
    - [ ] **Plan Create/Edit Form:**
        - [ ] Comprehensive form for all fields in the `plans` Firestore schema (name, description, price, currency, interval, all `features` map fields, `isPubliclyVisible`, `displayOrder`).
        - [ ] Client-side validation.
        - [ ] On submit, call appropriate backend API (`POST` or `PUT`).
        - [ ] Handle API responses, show loading states, display success/error messages.
    - [ ] Implement confirmation modals for archiving plans.
- [ ] **Testing:**
    - [ ] Test creating various plans (monthly, yearly - if interval is supported).
    - [ ] Verify Stripe Products and Prices are created/archived correctly in the Stripe Dashboard.
    - [ ] Test updating plan details (pricing and non-pricing). Verify Stripe entities.
    - [ ] Test archiving plans. Verify Stripe Price is archived.
    - [ ] Test all error conditions from Stripe (e.g., invalid currency, amount too low).
    - [ ] Test UI validation and API error display.

## Notes/Considerations:
*   This is a critical and complex feature involving financial transactions (setting up what users will pay for). Testing must be extremely thorough, especially interactions with Stripe.
*   Use Stripe's test mode extensively during development and staging.
*   The TDD `tech-design.dynamic-plans-stripe.md` provides the detailed logic for backend operations, especially regarding Stripe Product/Price lifecycle management.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 3-5d for backend, 2-3d for UI) reflects the complexity. Backend includes all Stripe API interactions.
*   Impact on existing subscriptions: As defined in the TDD, changes here primarily affect *new* subscriptions. Existing subscriptions continue on their original Stripe Price unless explicitly migrated (which is out of V1 scope).
*   Ensure the `features` map in the UI form is dynamically generated if you plan for admins to add arbitrary features, or hardcoded if the feature set is fixed but configurable per plan. The current TDDs imply a fixed but configurable set.
*   The "Simplified V1" plan management (Build Step #16) should be gracefully replaced or hidden once this full dynamic system is active. Data migration from simplified plans might be needed if `planId`s or structure significantly changed, but Step #17 aimed to minimize this.
