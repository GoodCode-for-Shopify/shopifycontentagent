## Referenced TDDs/Documentation:
*   [Admin Dashboard: Implement Dynamic Plan Management with Stripe](36.implement-dynamic-plan-management-with-stripe.md) (Parent build step this UI belongs to)
*   [Admin Dashboard: Frontend Development](../../jules/admin-dashboard/jules.admin-dashboard-development.md) (Section: "3.2. Plan Configuration Interface")
*   [Admin Dashboard: Technical Design - Dynamic Plan Management & Stripe Integration](../../jules/admin-dashboard/tech-design.dynamic-plans-stripe.md) (Sections: "4. Admin Dashboard UI (Conceptual)", "3.1. Firestore: `plans` Collection" for field details)

## Step Details:
This step focuses specifically on the **frontend UI implementation** within the Admin Dashboard for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (archiving) dynamic subscription plans. This is a sub-component of the larger "Implement Dynamic Plan Management with Stripe" (Build Step #36) and relies on the backend APIs developed in that step.

**Key Activities:**
*   **Plan List Page UI:**
    *   Develop the UI to display a list of all plans fetched from `GET /api/admin/plans`.
    *   Use Shopify Polaris `Page`, `Card`, and `DataTable` or `ResourceList`.
    *   Display key plan attributes: Name, Price, Currency, Interval, Status (Active/Archived), Stripe Product ID, Stripe Price ID (for admin reference).
    *   Include a "Create New Plan" button.
    *   Provide actions for each plan in the list: "Edit" and "Archive".
*   **Plan Create/Edit Form UI:**
    *   Develop a form (e.g., on a separate page or in a modal) for creating new plans and editing existing ones.
    *   Use Polaris `Form`, `FormLayout`, `TextField`, `Select`, `Checkbox`, etc., for all configurable fields of a plan as defined in the `plans` Firestore schema (see `tech-design.dynamic-plans-stripe.md`). This includes:
        *   Basic info: `planName`, `description`, `price`, `currency`, `interval` (e.g., month/year).
        *   Status: `status` (e.g., active/archived - typically "active" on create, "archived" via delete action).
        *   Display settings: `isPubliclyVisible`, `displayOrder`.
        *   `features` map: All defined feature limits and flags (e.g., `productProcessingLimit`, `keywordGenerationLimit`, `relatedQuestions.enabled`, `relatedQuestions.maxQuestionsToRetrieve`, `aiImageGeneration.enabled`, `aiImageGeneration.monthlyLimit`, `allowWordPressExport`, `allowCustomStyling`, `supportLevel`).
    *   Implement client-side input validation.
    *   On form submission, make appropriate API calls (`POST /api/admin/plans` for create, `PUT /api/admin/plans/:planId` for edit).
    *   Handle loading states and display success/error messages from the API.
*   **Archive Plan UI:**
    *   Implement confirmation `Modal` when an admin clicks "Archive" to prevent accidental archiving.
    *   On confirmation, call `DELETE /api/admin/plans/:planId`.

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] **Plan List Page:**
    - [ ] Create React component for the plan list page.
    - [ ] Fetch data from `GET /api/admin/plans` and display in a `DataTable` or `ResourceList`.
    - [ ] Include columns for Name, Price, Interval, Status, Stripe IDs.
    - [ ] Add "Create New Plan" button linking to the plan form.
    - [ ] Implement "Edit" and "Archive" actions for each plan.
- [ ] **Plan Create/Edit Form Page/Modal:**
    - [ ] Create React component for the plan form.
    - [ ] Include all necessary Polaris input fields for plan attributes (name, description, price, currency, interval, `isPubliclyVisible`, `displayOrder`, and all fields within the `features` map).
    - [ ] Implement client-side validation for inputs (e.g., price must be a number, name is required).
    - [ ] On submit:
        - [ ] Gather form data.
        - [ ] Call `POST /api/admin/plans` (for new plans) or `PUT /api/admin/plans/:planId` (for existing plans).
        - [ ] Manage loading state.
        - [ ] Display success (e.g., toast notification, redirect to list) or error (e.g., banner with API error message) feedback.
- [ ] **Archive Plan Functionality:**
    - [ ] When "Archive" is clicked, display a Polaris `Modal` for confirmation.
    - [ ] On confirmation, call `DELETE /api/admin/plans/:planId`.
    - [ ] Update the plan list UI to reflect the "archived" status or remove from active list.
- [ ] **State Management:**
    - [ ] Utilize appropriate state management (local component state, React Context, or other libraries like Zustand/Redux) for forms, loading states, and data.
- [ ] **Testing (UI Focus):**
    - [ ] Test creating a new plan with all fields.
    - [ ] Test editing an existing plan (both pricing and non-pricing details).
    - [ ] Test archiving a plan and confirm UI update.
    - [ ] Test client-side validation messages.
    - [ ] Test display of API error messages.
    - [ ] Verify UI correctly reflects plan status (Active/Archived).

## Notes/Considerations:
*   This task specifically details the UI components for the CRUD operations on plans, which interface with the backend APIs developed in Build Step #36.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 2-3d) is for the frontend development of these CRUD interfaces.
*   User experience is important: forms should be intuitive, validation clear, and feedback prominent.
*   The `features` map section of the form could be complex; consider grouping these logically (e.g., "Usage Limits", "Feature Flags").
*   The list of features to configure should be driven by the `plans` schema in `tech-design.dynamic-plans-stripe.md` and `jules.admin-dashboard.infrastructure-setup.md`.
*   This UI will replace or significantly enhance the "Simplified V1" plan management UI from Step #16.
