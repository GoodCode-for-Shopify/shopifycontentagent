# 23. Shopify App Backend: Node.js Backend PAA Integration

**Parent Index:** [Content Agent Build Steps Index](index.md)

## Referenced TDDs/Documentation:
*   [Shopify App: Python PAA Service Setup](../../jules/shopify-app/jules.python-paa-service-setup.md) (Section 4: "Node.js Backend Integration")
*   [Implement and Deploy Python PAA Service (V1)](22.implement-and-deploy-python-paa-service-v1.md) (The service this step integrates with)
*   [Global API Error Handling Strategy](../../jules/tech-design.api-error-handling-strategy.md) (For handling errors from the PAA service call)

## Step Details:
This step involves implementing the logic within the main Node.js backend (Cloud Functions) to make HTTP calls to the V1 Python PAA service (deployed in the previous step). This integration is necessary to fetch "People Also Ask" data based on keywords, which will then be used in the article generation process.

**Key Activities:**
*   **Configuration:**
    *   Store the URL of the deployed Python PAA service as a Firebase environment variable (e.g., `paa_service.url`). This URL will be different for dev, staging, and prod environments.
*   **Node.js Backend Logic:**
    *   Create a helper function or service module in the Node.js backend to handle communication with the Python PAA service.
    *   This function will:
        *   Accept keywords, language, and region as input.
        *   Construct the JSON payload for the Python PAA service.
        *   Make an authenticated HTTP POST request to the Python PAA service URL. Authentication is typically handled by ensuring the Cloud Function calling the PAA service has an identity token that the PAA service can verify (if using IAM to secure the PAA service to allow only specific service accounts).
        *   Receive the JSON response from the PAA service.
        *   Handle potential errors from the HTTP call (e.g., network issues, PAA service errors) and transform them according to the global API error handling strategy if necessary.
*   **Integration with Content Generation Flow:**
    *   The existing backend endpoint responsible for "PAA question fetching" (part of Core Content Generation APIs) will be updated to use this new helper function to call the Python PAA service.

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] **Configuration:**
    - [ ] For each environment (dev, staging, prod), obtain the deployed URL of the Python PAA service.
    - [ ] Set this URL as a Firebase environment configuration variable (e.g., `firebase functions:config:set paa_service.url="URL_FOR_CURRENT_ENV"`).
- [ ] **Node.js Backend Implementation:**
    - [ ] Create a new module or helper function (e.g., `paaServiceClient.js`) for interacting with the PAA service.
    - [ ] **`callPaaService(keywords, language, region)` function:**
        - [ ] Retrieve the PAA service URL from Firebase environment configuration.
        - [ ] Construct the JSON request body: `{ keywords: [...], language: '...', region: '...' }`.
        - [ ] Make an HTTP POST request (e.g., using `axios` or `node-fetch`).
            - [ ] **Authentication:** Ensure the request is made with appropriate authentication for the PAA service. If the PAA service (e.g., a Cloud Function or Cloud Run) is IAM-protected to allow invocation only by specific service accounts (like the Node.js backend's service account), the call needs to be made with an identity token. Google Cloud client libraries for making HTTP requests from one function to another often handle this automatically if the calling function has the correct permissions.
            - For Cloud Functions calling other Cloud Functions: `google-auth-library` can be used to get an ID token for the target function URL.
            - For Cloud Functions calling Cloud Run: Similar mechanism using an ID token for the target Audience (Cloud Run URL).
        - [ ] Handle the response: Parse the JSON, return the `paa_results`.
        - [ ] Implement error handling:
            - Catch network errors, timeouts.
            - Handle non-2xx responses from the PAA service.
            - Log errors from the PAA service.
            - Potentially transform PAA service errors into standardized API errors for the client if the error needs to be propagated.
- [ ] **Update PAA Question Fetching API Endpoint:**
    - [ ] Modify the existing backend API endpoint that the Shopify App frontend calls for PAA questions (e.g., `POST /api/content/get-related-questions`).
    - [ ] This endpoint should now call the new `callPaaService` helper function.
    - [ ] Process the results from `callPaaService` and return them to the frontend, respecting plan limits (`relatedQuestions.maxQuestionsToRetrieve`).
- [ ] **Testing:**
    - [ ] Unit test the `callPaaService` helper function (mocking HTTP requests).
    - [ ] Integration test: Make a call from the Shopify App backend's PAA question fetching endpoint to the deployed Python PAA service (in the `dev` environment).
    - [ ] Verify successful data retrieval and correct error handling for various scenarios (PAA service down, invalid input to PAA service, etc.).

## Notes/Considerations:
*   The method for authenticating the request from the Node.js backend to the Python PAA service is crucial. Using IAM and identity tokens is the recommended Google Cloud approach for service-to-service authentication.
*   Ensure the PAA service URL in Firebase config is updated for each environment (dev, staging, prod) during CI/CD or manual promotion.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 4-8h) is for creating the client logic in Node.js, integrating it, and basic testing. Setting up service-to-service authentication correctly can sometimes take extra effort if unfamiliar.
*   Error handling should be robust. If the PAA service fails, the main content generation flow should still be able to proceed gracefully (e.g., with no PAA questions, or by using an AI fallback if implemented later).
*   This step makes the Python PAA service usable by the rest of the application.
