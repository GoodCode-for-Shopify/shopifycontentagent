## Referenced TDDs/Documentation:
*   [Content Agent Shopify App: Overview and Setup](../../jules/shopify-app/jules.app-overview-and-setup.md) (Section: "2.6. Basic App Structure (React/Polaris)")
*   Shopify Polaris Documentation (for `AppProvider`)
*   Shopify App Bridge Documentation (for `Provider`)

## Step Details:
This step involves setting up the basic structure for the React frontend of the Shopify App. This includes wrapping the application with Shopify Polaris's `AppProvider` for styling and internationalization, and with Shopify App Bridge's `Provider` to enable communication with the Shopify Admin.

**Key Activities:**
*   Modify the main application component (e.g., `App.jsx` or `App.js` in the `web/frontend/src` directory of the Shopify app project) to include these providers.
*   Configure App Bridge `Provider` with the Shopify App API key and the shop origin (obtained from the URL).
*   Set up basic client-side routing using `react-router-dom` to define how different pages/views of the app will be rendered.

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] **Locate Main App Component:** Identify the main entry point component for your React app (e.g., `web/frontend/src/App.jsx`).
- [ ] **Install/Verify Dependencies:** Ensure `@shopify/polaris`, `@shopify/app-bridge-react`, and `react-router-dom` are installed.
- [ ] **Implement Polaris `AppProvider`:**
    - [ ] Import `AppProvider` from `@shopify/polaris`.
    - [ ] Import Polaris CSS: `import '@shopify/polaris/build/esm/styles.css';`.
    - [ ] Import Polaris English translations: `import enTranslations from '@shopify/polaris/locales/en.json';`.
    - [ ] Wrap the root of your application with `<AppProvider i18n={enTranslations}>...</AppProvider>`.
- [ ] **Implement App Bridge `Provider`:**
    - [ ] Import `Provider` from `@shopify/app-bridge-react`.
    - [ ] Get Shopify App API Key (this needs to be available to the frontend, typically via environment variables set during the build process, e.g., `process.env.SHOPIFY_API_KEY`).
    - [ ] Get the shop origin from the URL query parameters (e.g., `URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get("shop")`).
    - [ ] Construct the App Bridge configuration object:
        ```javascript
        // const appBridgeConfig = {
        //   apiKey: process.env.REACT_APP_SHOPIFY_API_KEY, // Example environment variable
        //   host: new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get("host"),
        //   forceRedirect: true,
        // };
        ```
    - [ ] Wrap the Polaris `AppProvider` (or its children) with the App Bridge `<Provider config={appBridgeConfig}>...</Provider>`.
- [ ] **Basic Routing Setup (`react-router-dom`):**
    - [ ] Import `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, `Route` from `react-router-dom`.
    - [ ] Define a basic set of routes within the `AppProvider` and `Provider` context (e.g., a home route `/` and potentially a placeholder for `/onboarding` or `/settings`).
    - [ ] Create simple placeholder components for these initial routes.
- [ ] **Test Basic Rendering:**
    - [ ] Run the app locally using `npm run dev` (or the appropriate command from the Shopify CLI project).
    - [ ] Ensure the app loads within a Shopify development store (using tunneling like ngrok or Shopify CLI's built-in tunnel) without console errors related to Polaris or App Bridge setup.
    - [ ] Verify that basic Polaris styling is applied.

## Notes/Considerations:
*   The `host` parameter for App Bridge config (which is the base64 encoded shop origin) is crucial for App Bridge to function correctly and securely. The `shop` parameter (plain text shop origin) is also usually available and needed.
*   Environment variables for `SHOPIFY_API_KEY` (for App Bridge config) need to be correctly set up in your frontend build process (e.g., using `.env` files for local development, and CI/CD variables for deployed environments).
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 2-4h) is for the initial setup of these providers and basic routing.
*   This structure forms the foundation upon which all other frontend UI components and pages for the Shopify app will be built.
*   Error handling for App Bridge initialization (e.g., missing API key or host) should be considered.
*   The order of `AppProvider` and App Bridge `Provider` might matter depending on specific needs; typically App Bridge `Provider` can be inside `AppProvider`.
