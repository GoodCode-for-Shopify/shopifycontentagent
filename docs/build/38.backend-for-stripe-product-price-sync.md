## Step Details:
This step focuses specifically on the **backend logic implementation** for synchronizing plan configurations from the Admin Dashboard with Stripe. This involves creating and managing Stripe Product and Price objects corresponding to the plans defined by administrators. This is a core part of the "Implement Dynamic Plan Management with Stripe" (Build Step #36).

**Key Activities (within the Admin API Plan Management Endpoints - `/api/admin/plans`):**
*   **On Plan Creation (`POST /api/admin/plans`):**
    1.  After validating admin input for a new plan from the dashboard.
    2.  Create a new Stripe Product (e.g., "Content Agent - Pro Plan"). Store the Firestore `planId` in the Stripe Product's `metadata` for cross-referencing.
    3.  Create a new Stripe Price associated with the above Stripe Product, including `unit_amount`, `currency`, and `recurring: {interval}`. Store the Firestore `planId` in the Stripe Price's `metadata`.
    4.  Save the Stripe Product ID and Stripe Price ID to the new plan document in Firestore.
*   **On Plan Update (`PUT /api/admin/plans/:planId`):**
    1.  If pricing details (price amount, currency, interval) are changed:
        *   Archive the old Stripe Price object associated with the plan by setting `active: false`.
        *   Create a new Stripe Price object with the updated pricing details, linked to the *same* Stripe Product. Store Firestore `planId` in metadata.
        *   Update the Firestore plan document with the new Stripe Price ID and add the old Price ID to a `legacyPriceIds` array for history.
    2.  If non-pricing details like plan name or description are changed:
        *   Update the corresponding Stripe Product's `name` or `description` if necessary.
*   **On Plan Archival (`DELETE /api/admin/plans/:planId`):**
    1.  When an admin archives a plan in the dashboard:
        *   Archive the current Stripe Price object associated with the plan (`active: false`). This prevents new subscriptions at this price.
        *   (Optional V1) Consider archiving the Stripe Product itself if no other active Prices are linked to it. This requires checking other plans or having a clear strategy for Product reuse. For V1, just archiving the Price is often sufficient.

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] **Stripe SDK Setup:**
    - [ ] Ensure Stripe Node.js library is installed in `functions`.
    - [ ] Initialize Stripe with the secret key from Firebase environment configuration.
- [ ] **Enhance `POST /api/admin/plans` (Create Plan):**
    - [ ] Add logic to create a Stripe Product. Include `metadata: { firestorePlanId: newPlan.id }`.
    - [ ] Add logic to create a Stripe Price, linking to the new Stripe Product. Include `metadata: { firestorePlanId: newPlan.id }`.
    - [ ] Save both `stripeProductId` and `stripePriceId` to the Firestore plan document.
    - [ ] Implement error handling for Stripe API calls.
- [ ] **Enhance `PUT /api/admin/plans/:planId` (Update Plan):**
    - [ ] Fetch the existing plan from Firestore.
    - [ ] If `price`, `currency`, or `interval` has changed:
        - [ ] Call `stripe.prices.update(existingPlan.stripePriceId, { active: false });` to archive the old Stripe Price.
        - [ ] Create a new Stripe Price with new details, linked to `existingPlan.stripeProductId`. Include metadata.
        - [ ] Update the Firestore document with the `newStripePriceId` and add `existingPlan.stripePriceId` to `legacyPriceIds`.
    - [ ] If `planName` or `description` changed, call `stripe.products.update(existingPlan.stripeProductId, { name: ..., description: ... });`.
    - [ ] Implement error handling for Stripe API calls.
- [ ] **Enhance `DELETE /api/admin/plans/:planId` (Archive Plan):**
    - [ ] After setting plan status to "archived" in Firestore:
    - [ ] Call `stripe.prices.update(planData.stripePriceId, { active: false });` to archive the Stripe Price.
    - [ ] (V1 scope decision) Implement logic to check if the Stripe Product should also be archived (e.g., if no other active prices are associated with it). For V1, simply archiving the price might be enough.
    - [ ] Implement error handling for Stripe API calls.
- [ ] **Testing (Backend Focus):**
    - [ ] Use Stripe's test mode for all development and automated tests.
    - [ ] Verify that creating a plan in the Admin Dashboard correctly creates corresponding Product and Price objects in Stripe with correct metadata.
    - [ ] Verify that updating plan pricing correctly archives the old Stripe Price and creates a new one, updating Firestore.
    - [ ] Verify that updating plan name/description updates the Stripe Product.
    - [ ] Verify that archiving a plan correctly archives the Stripe Price.
    - [ ] Test Stripe API error handling (e.g., invalid API key, incorrect parameters).

## Notes/Considerations:
*   This task focuses on the backend logic within the plan management API endpoints developed as part of Build Step #36.
*   Refer to `tech-design.dynamic-plans-stripe.md` for detailed logic flows and considerations on Stripe object management.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 2-3d) is for implementing and testing these specific Stripe interactions within the existing API structure.
*   Idempotency for Stripe creation calls might be considered for more advanced scenarios but for admin-driven actions, careful UI design to prevent double submissions is often sufficient for V1.
*   Ensure all Stripe object IDs are correctly stored and retrieved from Firestore.
*   This backend logic is crucial for keeping your application's plan definitions in sync with Stripe's billing entities.
*   The decision on whether to archive Stripe Products when all associated Prices are archived depends on whether you want to reuse Product IDs or keep them as a historical record. Archiving Prices is the most critical part to stop new subscriptions.
