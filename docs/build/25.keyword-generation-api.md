## Step Details:
This step involves creating a backend API endpoint that the Shopify App frontend will use for keyword generation. The API will take product information (obtained in the previous step) as input, use an AI service (e.g., Gemini AI) to brainstorm an initial list of keywords, and then potentially validate or get search volume insights for these keywords using the Google Ads API (depending on V1 scope and credential availability).

**Key Activities:**
*   **Backend (Cloud Functions - Express App):**
    *   Define a new route, e.g., `POST /api/content/generate-keywords`.
    *   This endpoint must be protected by the `authenticateShopifyRequest` middleware to identify the `shop_id`.
    *   **Logic:**
        1.  Accepts product data (e.g., titles, descriptions) from the request body.
        2.  Determine which API keys to use for Gemini AI and Google Ads API:
            *   Check if the tenant is on a plan that uses developer-provided keys.
            *   If not, or if the plan requires tenant-provided keys, retrieve the tenant's encrypted keys from Firestore (using `getDecryptedCredential`) for Gemini AI and Google Ads (if applicable for keyword validation/volume).
            *   If keys are unavailable or invalid, handle the error gracefully (e.g., return fewer keywords, skip validation, or inform the user).
        3.  **Keyword Brainstorming:** Call Gemini AI (or equivalent) with prompts based on product information to generate a list of potential keywords.
        4.  **Keyword Validation/Search Volume (Optional for MVP, or if Google Ads API integration is complex/deferred):**
            *   If integrating Google Ads API for search volume: Take the AI-generated keywords and query the Google Ads API (Keyword Planner services) to get search volume and other insights.
            *   Filter and rank keywords based on volume and relevance.
        5.  Return the list of generated (and possibly validated/ranked) keywords to the frontend, respecting any plan-based limits (`keywordGenerationLimit`).

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] **API Credential Handling Logic:**
    - [ ] Implement or verify robust logic to determine whether to use developer-provided or tenant-provided API keys for Gemini AI and Google Ads API, based on the shop's current plan and stored credentials.
    - [ ] Ensure `getDecryptedCredential` is used for tenant-provided keys.
- [ ] **Backend API Endpoint (`POST /api/content/generate-keywords`):**
    - [ ] Define the route in the Express app.
    - [ ] Apply `authenticateShopifyRequest` middleware.
    - [ ] **Core Logic:**
        - [ ] Get `shop_id` and product data from `req`.
        - [ ] Retrieve necessary API keys (Gemini, Google Ads) based on plan/tenant settings. Handle missing/invalid keys gracefully.
        - [ ] Construct prompts for Gemini AI using product data to brainstorm keywords.
        - [ ] Make API call(s) to Gemini AI.
        - [ ] **(Optional/If in Scope for V1)** If using Google Ads API:
            - [ ] Make API call(s) to Google Ads API (Keyword Planner) for search volume/validation. This requires careful setup of the Google Ads API client, including handling refresh tokens if user-specific Google Ads accounts are linked.
            - [ ] Process and rank keywords.
        - [ ] If not using Google Ads API for V1, return the raw list from Gemini or apply simpler filtering.
        - [ ] Apply plan-based `keywordGenerationLimit` to the final list.
        - [ ] Return the list of keywords.
    - [ ] Implement error handling (AI API errors, Google Ads API errors, credential errors) using the global API error handling strategy.
- [ ] **Testing:**
    - [ ] Test with valid product data and available API keys.
    - [ ] Test scenarios where tenant-provided API keys are missing or invalid.
    - [ ] Test scenarios where developer-provided keys are used.
    - [ ] Verify that plan limits on the number of keywords are respected.
    - [ ] Test error handling for API failures from Gemini or Google Ads.

## Notes/Considerations:
*   Integrating with Google Ads API for keyword validation/volume can be complex due to its own OAuth requirements (if acting on behalf of a user's Google Ads account) or the need for a manager account with API access. For MVP, relying solely on Gemini AI for keyword brainstorming might be a simpler starting point, deferring Google Ads integration.
*   The quality of AI-generated keywords will depend heavily on prompt engineering.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 1-2d) can vary significantly based on the depth of Google Ads API integration. If only Gemini AI is used, it might be closer to 1d. Full Google Ads integration could make it 2-3d or more.
*   Remember to track API usage for Gemini and Google Ads calls against tenant quotas or for internal monitoring, as per `docs/jules.authority.md` and build step for API Usage Tracking.
*   The definition of "developer-provided" vs "tenant-provided" Google Ads credentials needs careful thought, as Google Ads API typically works in the context of a specific Ads account. Refresh tokens are user-specific. A global developer API key might be for a different Google API (like just a generic Google Cloud API key for accessing some services, not specifically for a user's Ads account). This step might primarily use tenant-provided Google Ads credentials if direct Keyword Planner access is needed for their account context. If using a general keyword tool via a developer API key, that's different. Assume for now that if Google Ads is used, it's via tenant-provided credentials/OAuth.
