# 9. Admin Dashboard (Shell & Auth): `adminAuthMiddleware` for backend

**Parent Index:** [Content Agent Build Steps Index](index.md)

## Referenced TDDs/Documentation:
*   [Admin Dashboard: Backend Development](../../jules/admin-dashboard/jules.backend-development.md) (Section: "2.4. Authentication Middleware for Admin API Routes")
*   [Admin Dashboard: Security Implementation](../../jules/admin-dashboard/jules.security-implementation.md) (Section: "2. API Route Protection")

## Step Details:
This step focuses on implementing and applying the `adminAuthMiddleware` to the backend Express application (running on Cloud Functions). This middleware is critical for protecting API routes intended for the Admin Dashboard, ensuring that only authenticated administrators with the correct custom claims can access them.

**Key Activities:**
*   Develop the `adminAuthMiddleware` function as detailed in `docs/jules/admin-dashboard/jules.backend-development.md`. This middleware will:
    *   Extract the Firebase ID token from the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
    *   Verify the ID token using the Firebase Admin SDK.
    *   Check for the presence of an `isAdmin: true` custom claim on the decoded token.
    *   Grant access if the token is valid and the claim is present; otherwise, return a 403 Unauthorized/Forbidden error.
*   Apply this middleware to all Express routes that serve the Admin Dashboard's data and operational needs (e.g., routes under an `/api/admin` prefix).

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] **Develop `adminAuthMiddleware.js`:**
    - [ ] Create a new file (e.g., `functions/src/middleware/adminAuthMiddleware.js`).
    - [ ] Implement the middleware logic using `firebase-admin` to verify ID tokens and check for `isAdmin === true` custom claim.
    - [ ] Ensure it correctly sends a 403 status and appropriate message if authentication or authorization fails.
    - [ ] Add the authenticated user's decoded token (or UID) to the `req` object for use in downstream route handlers (e.g., `req.user`).
- [ ] **Integrate Middleware in Express App (`functions/src/index.js` or route files):**
    - [ ] Import the `adminAuthMiddleware`.
    - [ ] Create an Express router for admin-specific API routes (e.g., `adminApiRouter`).
    - [ ] Apply the `adminAuthMiddleware` to this router: `adminApiRouter.use(adminAuthMiddleware);`.
    - [ ] Mount this protected router under a specific prefix (e.g., `app.use('/api/admin', adminApiRouter);`).
    - [ ] Ensure any existing or future admin-related routes are defined on this protected router.
- [ ] **Testing:**
    - [ ] **Unit Test (Optional but Recommended):** Write unit tests for the middleware if possible, mocking Firebase Admin SDK calls to test different token/claim scenarios.
    - [ ] **Manual/Integration Test:**
        - [ ] Attempt to access a protected admin API route without a token – expect 403.
        - [ ] Attempt to access with a valid Firebase ID token from a non-admin user (without `isAdmin: true` claim) – expect 403.
        - [ ] Attempt to access with a valid Firebase ID token from an admin user (with `isAdmin: true` claim) – expect success (e.g., 200 OK from the route).
        - [ ] Use Firebase Local Emulators for easier testing of this functionality.

## Notes/Considerations:
*   The implementation details for the middleware are provided in `docs/jules/admin-dashboard/jules.backend-development.md`. This step is about integrating and testing it.
*   This middleware is crucial for the security of all Admin Dashboard backend operations.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 4-8h) includes development, integration into the Express app, and basic testing.
*   Ensure Firebase Admin SDK is initialized (`admin.initializeApp()`) before this middleware can function.
*   Custom claims (`isAdmin: true`) must be set on the admin user accounts in Firebase Authentication for this middleware to grant access (covered in step 7).
*   The Global API Error Handling strategy should be compatible with errors thrown by this middleware.
