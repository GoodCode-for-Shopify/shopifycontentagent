# 16. Admin Dashboard: Define Plan Tiers and Limits in UI (Simplified V1)

**Parent Index:** [Content Agent Build Steps Index](index.md)

## Referenced TDDs/Documentation:
*   [Development Roadmap](../../jules/development-roadmap.md) (Phase 1: MVP - Admin Dashboard)
*   [Admin Dashboard: Infrastructure Setup](../../jules/admin-dashboard/jules.infrastructure-setup.md) (Section 1.2 for `plans` collection schema)
*   [Admin Dashboard: Frontend Development](../../jules/admin-dashboard/jules.admin-dashboard-development.md) (Conceptual UI for Plan Configuration)
*   [Admin Dashboard: Backend Development](../../jules/admin-dashboard/jules.backend-development.md) (Initial, simplified plan management APIs if not yet the full dynamic/Stripe version)

## Step Details:
This step focuses on creating the initial, simplified Plan Management interface within the Admin Dashboard. For the MVP (Phase 1), this interface will allow admins to define features and limits for a few predefined plan tiers (e.g., Free, Basic, Pro). These configurations will be stored in Firestore. The full Stripe integration and dynamic creation of plans as per `tech-design.dynamic-plans-stripe.md` is deferred to Phase 2.

**Key Activities:**
*   **Frontend (Admin Dashboard - React/Polaris):**
    *   Develop a UI page for "Plan Management (Simplified)".
    *   This page might list a few hardcoded or pre-seeded plan stubs (e.g., "Free", "Basic", "Pro").
    *   For each plan stub, allow admins to view and edit its associated features and limits (e.g., `productProcessingLimit`, `keywordGenerationLimit`, `relatedQuestions.enabled`, `relatedQuestions.maxQuestionsToRetrieve`).
    *   Use Polaris form components for input.
    *   On save, the frontend calls a simplified backend API endpoint to update these plan details in Firestore.
*   **Backend (Cloud Functions - Express App):**
    *   Implement a simplified API endpoint (e.g., `PUT /api/admin/plans/:planId/config` or similar) that accepts the feature/limit configuration for a given, predefined `planId`.
    *   This endpoint updates the corresponding plan document in the Firestore `plans` collection. It does *not* interact with Stripe in this phase.
*   **Firestore:**
    *   Ensure the `plans` collection can store these feature/limit configurations as defined in `jules.admin-dashboard.infrastructure-setup.md`. Initial plan documents might need to be seeded manually in Firestore or by a setup script.

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] **Firestore Setup:**
    - [ ] Manually create/seed initial documents in the `plans` collection for "Free", "Basic", "Pro" tiers if they don't exist. Include basic fields like `planName`, `tier`, and placeholders for `features`.
- [ ] **Backend (Simplified API Endpoint):**
    - [ ] Define and implement a route (e.g., `PUT /api/admin/plans/:planId`) that allows updating the `features` map (and potentially `description`, `status`) of a specific plan document in Firestore.
    - [ ] Ensure this endpoint is protected by `adminAuthMiddleware`.
    - [ ] No Stripe interaction in this version of the endpoint.
- [ ] **Frontend (Admin Dashboard UI):**
    - [ ] Create a new page/route for "Plan Management (Simplified)".
    - [ ] Display a list of the predefined plans (e.g., fetched from Firestore via a `GET /api/admin/plans` that returns these simplified plans).
    - [ ] For each plan, provide an "Edit" action that navigates to a form.
    - [ ] **Plan Edit Form:**
        - [ ] Display current plan name/tier (read-only for this simplified version).
        - [ ] Provide input fields (Polaris `TextField` for numbers, `Checkbox` for booleans) for features like:
            - `productProcessingLimit`
            - `keywordGenerationLimit`
            - `relatedQuestions.enabled`
            - `relatedQuestions.maxQuestionsToRetrieve`
            - (Add other key features relevant to MVP)
        - [ ] On submit, call the simplified backend `PUT` endpoint to save the changes to Firestore.
        - [ ] Implement loading states and display success/error messages.
- [ ] **Forward Compatibility:**
    - [ ] Review the Firestore structure for these simplified plans and ensure it's reasonably forward-compatible with the more detailed schema planned for Phase 2 (dynamic plans with Stripe IDs, etc., as per `tech-design.dynamic-plans-stripe.md`). The `features` map should align.

## Notes/Considerations:
*   This is a **simplified V1** of plan management. The goal is to get basic plan limits into Firestore so the Shopify app can use them for MVP.
*   Full dynamic plan creation, pricing configuration, and Stripe Product/Price synchronization are **deferred** to Phase 2 (Build Step #36).
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 2-3d) is for creating this simplified UI and the corresponding backend endpoint for updating Firestore.
*   The UI should clearly indicate that this is a simplified management interface and that full Stripe integration is pending.
*   This step focuses on defining the *limits* and *features* of plans, not their pricing or Stripe representation.
