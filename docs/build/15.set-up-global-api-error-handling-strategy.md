## Referenced TDDs/Documentation:
*   [Global API Error Handling Strategy](../../jules/tech-design.api-error-handling-strategy.md)
*   [Server-Side and Database Setup](../../jules/serverside-setup.md) (where the Express app is initially structured)
*   [Admin Dashboard: Backend Development](../../jules/admin-dashboard/jules.backend-development.md) (as an example consumer of this strategy)

## Step Details:
This step involves implementing the global API error handling strategy for the backend Express application (running on Cloud Functions). This strategy, defined in `docs/jules/tech-design.api-error-handling-strategy.md`, ensures consistent JSON error responses, correct HTTP status code usage, and robust logging.

**Key Activities:**
*   **Develop Central Error Handling Middleware:**
    *   Create an Express error handling middleware function (e.g., `apiErrorHandler` in `functions/src/middleware/errorHandler.js`).
    *   This middleware will be responsible for catching all errors passed via `next(error)`.
    *   It will format the error into the standardized JSON response structure:
        ```json
        {
          "error": {
            "code": "ERROR_CODE_IDENTIFIER",
            "message": "Human-readable message.",
            "details": [ /* ...optional... */ ],
            "type": "ErrorType",
            "requestId": "unique-request-id"
          }
        }
        ```
    *   It will set the appropriate HTTP status code based on the error type or a `statusCode` property on the error object.
    *   It will log errors comprehensively (as per logging strategy).
*   **Define Custom Error Classes (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   Create custom error classes (e.g., `ValidationError`, `NotFoundError`, `AuthError`, `ForbiddenError`) that extend the base `Error` class and include properties like `statusCode`, `errorCode`, `errorDetails`, `errorType`. This makes throwing standardized errors from route handlers cleaner.
*   **Request ID Middleware:**
    *   Implement or use a middleware to generate/attach a unique request ID to each incoming request (e.g., `req.id`), which is then included in error responses and logs for tracing.
*   **Integrate into Express App:**
    *   Register the `apiErrorHandler` middleware as the last middleware in the Express app stack in `functions/src/index.js`.
    *   Ensure route handlers use `try...catch` blocks and pass errors to `next(error)` or throw custom error instances.

## Action Items/Checklist:
- [ ] **Create Error Handling Middleware (`apiErrorHandler`):**
    - [ ] Define the middleware function signature `(err, req, res, next)`.
    - [ ] Extract `statusCode`, `errorCode`, `message`, `details`, `type` from the `err` object (with defaults for unexpected errors).
    - [ ] Implement logic to make error messages generic for 500 errors in production (check `process.env.NODE_ENV`).
    - [ ] Implement comprehensive error logging (timestamp, request ID, user/shop ID if available, path, method, full error details, stack trace). (Initially `console.error`, to be replaced by structured logger).
    - [ ] Send the standardized JSON error response with the correct `statusCode`.
- [ ] **Create Custom Error Classes (e.g., `ValidationError`, `NotFoundError`):**
    - [ ] Define classes that extend `Error`.
    - [ ] Constructor should accept parameters like message, details, and set properties like `statusCode`, `errorCode`, `errorType`.
- [ ] **Implement Request ID Middleware (Optional but Recommended):**
    - [ ] Add a middleware (e.g., using `uuid` package) at the beginning of the request chain to generate `req.id`.
- [ ] **Integrate into Main Express App (`functions/src/index.js`):**
    - [ ] Register the request ID middleware (if used).
    - [ ] Register the `apiErrorHandler` as the *last* piece of middleware using `app.use(apiErrorHandler);`.
- [ ] **Refactor Existing/Initial Routes (if any):**
    - [ ] Ensure any existing route handlers use `try...catch` and `next(error)` for error propagation.
    - [ ] Start using custom error classes for throwing specific types of errors (e.g., `throw new ValidationError(...)`).
- [ ] **Testing:**
    - [ ] Test different error scenarios:
        - [ ] Throw a custom `ValidationError` from a route -> verify 400 status and JSON response format.
        - [ ] Throw a generic `Error` from a route -> verify 500 status and JSON response format (with generic message in prod).
        - [ ] Test a route that doesn't exist -> verify 404 (if Express handles this before your middleware, or if your middleware handles it).
        - [ ] Verify error logging includes request ID and other context.

## Notes/Considerations:
*   The detailed specification for the error format, status codes, and middleware logic is in `docs/jules/tech-design.api-error-handling-strategy.md`.
*   This global error handler is crucial for creating a predictable and maintainable API.
*   The placeholder time estimate (e.g., 1-2d) includes setting up the middleware, a few custom error classes, and basic testing.
*   Logging will initially use `console.error` as per the TDD example, with a plan to integrate a more structured logging service later.
*   This strategy will be applied to both the Admin Dashboard backend and the Shopify App backend, as they share the same Express app instance in the current Firebase Functions structure.
